This test exercises two features: 

1) to have default datetime upon insert: DB will auto populate fields 
   dt and dtu (see t1.csc2 schema file) at the moment of actual insert
   Note that dtu is a default populated field of type datetimeus and 
   made it a key in this example.

2) to have trigger update the value of datetime dt field upon update of
   a row in table t1.
