This testcase reproduces a "Timeout while reading response from server" error
reported by a customer.  The test does a 'selectv', and then an update on the
same handle- neither of these is protected by a transaction.  Database trace
shows that a replicant is attempting to replay a verify-retry, but that the
sql-history is NULL.

clnt->has_recording stays lit, and this prevents us from saving history.  I
modified run_stmt_setup to overwrite clnt->has_recording with the vdbe 
recording flag if the handle is not currently in a transaction.
