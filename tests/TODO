Test suite TODO (priority order?):
[X] timeout for prepare/copy/test
[X] remove all dependencies on comdb2sc -- clustered tests dont work with comdb2sc
[X] fix any DDL with csc2 keyword
[X] convert all testcases to use 'default' and ${CDB2_OPTIONS} with cdb2sql
[X] apply any patches on tests branch back to master
[X] dbname should take a prefix so you can run multiple (same) tests at once (mtao)
[X] test output files should have dbname for multiple (same) tests at once
[X] generated cdb2api file should have db name, not comdb2db for multiple (same) tests at once
[X] any tests that write to /tmp should prefix with a pid, for multiple (same) tests at once
[X] any tests that write to /tmp should clean up /tmp on make clean
[X] comdb2 path - copy binary, run with it? uses /opt/bb/bin/comdb2 by default
[X] have a way to run before make install?  on cluster before make install?
[ ] database should already have sane defaults.  consider merging default_options
[X] fix tools to pass CDB2_CONFIG for cdb2api
[X] fix tools/scripts to not rely on mikedb/local (use $DBNAME/default)
[X] way to clean up test databases on remote cluster: only for successful tests
[ ] testrunner: error on invalid tests 
[ ] get rid of any lrl options in tests that are already default
[ ] fix: stat4dump crashes the db -- datacopy.test has that portion disabled
[ ] fix: dryrun for SC -- instant_sc.test t20 has dryrun disabled
[X] explicitly specifying master for cdb2sql should make the query run on master. 
[X} suite should select comdb2_host() and make sure every machine returns
    itself before declaring that a cluster is ready


Unrelated bugs found:
[ ] non-llmeta if missing lrl options - should give better error


Would be nice:
[ ] 80% of the test scripts are almost identical: run req files, diff with 
    expected output. Have a single script in tools. At the least import from 
    a common file any core functionality that is similar in tests.
[ ] nicer/safer way to stop any runaway tests
[ ] want 'running/setting/up/etc.' output? little program to show progress of test?


TESTS still to be fixed:
recom_replay.test         -- I dont see errors anymore in single node, let's reenable the test (Lingzhi)
     -- now all threads have verify error: Thread 7f989bfff700 verify error.
     prior:
        error -8 while running 'COMMIT' on iter 0
        Thread 2aee81b67700 error -105 while running 'UPDATE t1 SET id=3 WHERE id=2'
	    select count(*) from book where id = 8 AND high_water_sequence = 1 at line 159 with ret -3
serialstep.test           -- rewrite test to get counts of relevant updated rows
snap_ha_retry.test        -- hatest task core dumps (disconnect_cdb2h hatest.c:451)
                             set transaction snapshot isolation   returns effects (garbage)

flaky:
sc_tableversion
sc_swapfields
sc_versmistmatch
sc_resume
