# The test creates a sparse table on the fly. Note that
# we check page fill factor only when we bring in a page.
# Hence a small cache size is necessary to easily page out
# dirty and sparse pages (by doing a select * on a helper table)
# and page in these pages again (by doing a select * on the
# sparse table)
