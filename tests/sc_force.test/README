Alter table has a force mode that forces the schemachange to go through even when the
database deems it unsafe. 
This test does the following :
1.) Simulates a low headroom scenario, forcing the database to prevent the schemachange
2.) Subsequently runs the same schemachange with the 'force' option and tests to see that 
    the schemachange succeeds
