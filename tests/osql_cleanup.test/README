Verify correct osql cleanup under rollbacks and clients not closing db connections.

When a client calls rollback (or disconnects), we remove them from the osql hash
immediately (or after connetion closes), so there should be no items in the hash
after all clients have disconnected. Note that replicant sends osql schedule immediately
to masternode without waiting for commit. This test only exercises newsql queries.

NB: due to the high number of threads that dont close, the db will run out of appsock
connections and client will see error:

12:50:49> Error: cdb2_run_statement failed: -23 Exhausted appsock connections.

server will have these errors:

2020/11/26 12:54:29 [ERROR] 0x7feb4675e770 ctrl engine has wrong state 6 0 0x7feb46760700

and proceed to cleanup:

2020/11/26 12:54:29 osql_sess_rcvop: cancelled transaction

In fact there are exacly as many calls to osql_sess_rcvop() to cleanup as there are calls
to osql_repository_add() to add osql entry.
