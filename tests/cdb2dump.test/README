This testcase uses cdb2_dump to dump the content of one of the btrees
in which we have inserted data, and make sure that the content dumped 
matches a given string. 

It is useful both to test the correctness of the cdb2_dump tool and 
the content of the btree, as well as to demonstrate using such tool.
