Simple test to make sure table locks are acquired after an
sql recovery phase.  Sql recovery is triggered by a master swing.
The table is dropped after the sql recovery.  If the table locks
are properly re-acquired, the drop operation pauses and waits for 
sql to finish.  Otherwise table is dropped and the replicant running
the sql crashes.
