Test restart of socksql.

When a replicant sends the osql stream to master and in the middle of sending 
there is a failure, we restart from the beginning. This test makes sure that 
the restart is successful.

TODO: Currently when the replicant sends to the master commit and looses connection, 
it will get a verify retry and try again, this time it may see a NEW (different) number of
rows affected. Master checks in blkseq that this transaction actually commited and 
so returns a good rc to the replicant (does not rerun the transaction). Replicant 
sees the good rc and reports to the client the NEW number of rows affected, which 
is not correct--we should store in blkseq the number of rows affected and report them
back to client. As part of this we should add the number of cascaded rows that was
done by a transaction, store that in blkseq, and return that to the replicant, which
in turn can relay that to the client.
