This test attempts to verify that SQL queries executed inside (and outside) of
stored procedures end up being normalized and added to the fingerprints system
table, along with their cost metrics.

-------------------------------- SPECIAL NOTES --------------------------------

The "t03.req" test file purposely excludes the following fingerprints from its
result set (i.e. via the WHERE clause):

    4f16a8ec9db90f803e406659938b2602: "SELECT 1" ==> "SELECT?;"
    69d1558c950bbb908f4b8df0d63e2cf4: "SELECT comdb2_host();"
    812bdde365a22a61bcd52bf005990c37: "EXEC PROCEDURE sys.cmd.send(?);"

The corresponding SQL statements are excluded because these are (sometimes?)
used by the test suite itself at various stages.  Since the exact quantity
of these SQL statements is not deterministic, they must be excluded.
