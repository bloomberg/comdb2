This test is exercising the ability to recover from incompatible remote schema
changes, like adding a column.  In this case, the new sql will fail with the 
cached old schema.  Instead of sending a syntax error back to the client, the
source db needs to try to double-check the versions of all remote tables 
involved in the statement and refresh if stale schemas are detected.
