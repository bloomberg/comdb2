This test exercises the ability of SC to resume after a master downgrade
and after a crash.


send("downgrade") should not stop SC if single node.

When a new master gets selected, it calls new_master_callback(), where we 
load_auto_analyze_counters(), and we also resume_schema_change(), which 
after figuring out what table is being schemachanged, calls 
start_schema_change() which after setting sc_set_running(), it starts 
a thread to do_schema_change_thd().

We set SC_RESTART_SEC to test when restart will happen. That is used in 
wait_to_resume() to resume sc with a delay. That delaying occurs in 
do_schema_change_thd(). In order to have all db inserts, updates and deletes
in new btree, we need to init_sc_genids() before we sleep. The reason we had 
the sleep in there is to give the system a chance to come up--need to find 
out what is missing and when is it available, in order to have SC start after
that point without sleeping.
