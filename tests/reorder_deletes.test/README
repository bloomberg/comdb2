Test reordering of deletes: deletes into table t1 in a random order will have
indices conflicting in the order of page locks thus resulting in deadlocks
(if not reordered).
With reorder on there should many fewer deadlocks (< 100).

With reorder off the conflicts arise in the indices, so we expect many more 
( > 100) deadlocks.
