This test targets the distributed nature of remote sql schema.
There are three levels of information:
V1 = schema in the remote server for the targetted remote table
V2 = cached schema in the source server
V3 = cached schema in any sqlite engine in the source server
There are two types of conflicts:
L1 = differences between V2 and V1 (direct)
L2 = differences between V3 and V2 (indirect)
