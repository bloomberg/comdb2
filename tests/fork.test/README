This test checks that we can pass the cdb2 handle from a parent to a child
process when issuing fork() by using flag CDB2_INVALIDATE_PARENT_FORK when
opening db connection.

By default, if such flag is not provided, parent only is allowed to use
cdb2 handle and child should get errors.

Also, this test makes sure that we can open a new db connection and make
queries via it, after a fork().
