Test reordering of inserts: inserting into table t1 with 7 columns and 7 indices. 
With reorder on there should be a very small ( < 100) number of deadlocks during
insert stemming from conflicts when splitting pages.
With reorder off the conflicts arise in the indices, so we expect many more 
( > 1000) deadlocks.
