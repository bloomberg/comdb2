(ns jepsen.core
  "Entry point for all Jepsen tests. Coordinates the setup of servers, running
  tests, creating and resolving failures, and interpreting results.

  Jepsen tests a system by running a set of singlethreaded *processes*, each
  representing a single client in the system, and a special *nemesis* process,
  which induces failures across the cluster. Processes choose operations to
  perform based on a *generator*. Each process uses a *client* to apply the
  operation to the distributed system, and records the invocation and
  completion of that operation in the *history* for the test. When the test is
  complete, a *checker* analyzes the history to see if it made sense.

  Jepsen automates the setup and teardown of the environment and distributed
  system by using an *OS* and *client* respectively. See `run!` for details."
