This test exercises REBUILD command with table options which were introduced
as part of RDSICOMDB2-229

A few points about the test: 
    1. IPU, ISC and COMPRESSION require ODH to be enabled. As a result,
       the strategy for the test is :
       a.) create table => this should have ODH on, IPU on, ISC on, 
                           COMPRESS CRLE, BLOBCOMPRESS LZ4
       b.) turn off flags using REBUILD in the following order: 
           IPU OFF -> ISC OFF -> BLOBFIELD NONE -> REC NONE -> ODH OFF 
           , and verify flags with stat compr after every run
