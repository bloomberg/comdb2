This test will perform validation of two types of stripe ordering for inserts, 
round robin and thread affinity. It comes in the form of a unit test because
I need to have one DB with start time lrl option 'round_robin_stripes' and 
another without that option set.

In round robin scheme, each insert goes to subsequent stripe, whereas with thread
affinity we choose a stripe at client connect and all inserts that client issues
go to that same stripe.

For round robin validation, we use table t1 and insert N records to check 
that all stripes get N/stripe_count records (by doing pgdump).

For thread affinity, we insert N records into table t2 from a client, and check
that all rows were inserted in the same stripe, and the other stripes have
zero rows.

We use send bdb dblist to see the list of files to find the one pertaining to table t1 
and we use send bdb pgdump fileid 1 to dump page 1 of that file.
