This test exercises the ability to quickly fetch default dbstore values for 
previous versions of a table:
 - inserts records to a table with 1000 columns, 999 of which have dbstore
 - alters table so 999 columns have a different dbstore
 - perform several selects with a where condition on table

Using the field version cache allows for the selects to be very fast, 
older code was very inneficient and would timeout on this test.
