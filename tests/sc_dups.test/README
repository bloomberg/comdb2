This test case concerns the scenario where we insert and update records in a
table in a way causing unique constraint violation in one of the indices, 
meanwhile schemachange is running. 

The problem is with the way that the new btree 
gets updated--it can not be updated immediately because it will cause
a failure in adding to the new index, and this causes schema change to abort erroneously.

The update transaction should be the only one to abort and the schemachange should keep running.

There is an improved (and extended) version of this test at sc_dups_improved.
