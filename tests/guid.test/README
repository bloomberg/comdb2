Insert guid in field id primary key of size 16 bytes.

Test uniqueness of guid() also serves as an example usage:
populate id field with random unique data using function guid() (from libuuid).

Also, while randomblob(16) can be used as a second key, it is not unique 
when inserting from several threads in parallel, as this test does.
