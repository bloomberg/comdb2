The following case results in data loss; can't rebuild.

Schema change vutf8[16] column to vutf8, and then update a row
behind the sc cursor to another string that fits into the original inline length

 ...  record N ... record N+1
          \                \
           \                +-- sc cursor
            \
             +-- UPDATE t SET col = "F00D"
