The following case results in a read offset error in berkdb; schemachange subsequently fails at runtime.

Schema change vutf8 column to vutf8[16], make the column a key, and then update a row
behind the sc cursor to an empty string

 ...  record N ... record N+1
          \                \
           \                +-- sc cursor
            \
             +-- UPDATE t SET col = ""
