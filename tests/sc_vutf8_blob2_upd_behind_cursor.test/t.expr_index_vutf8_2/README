The following case result in a segfault in blockprocessor cleanup; schema change proceeds after database comes up again.

Schema change vutf8 column to vutf8[16], make the column a key, and then update a row
behind the sc cursor to another string that fits into the original inline length

 ...  record N ... record N+1
          \                \
           \                +-- sc cursor
            \
             +-- UPDATE t SET col = "F00D"
