Test reordering of updates: updates into table t1 in a random order will have
indices conflicting in the order of page locks thus resulting in deadlocks
(if not reordered).
With reorder on there should be almost zero deadlocks during the updates.

With reorder off the conflicts arise in the indices, so we expect many more 
( > 100) deadlocks.
