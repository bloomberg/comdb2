This tests runs two transactions which deadlock with each other 
by inserting into two tables in opposite order:
T1: insert into t1 then t2
T2: insert into t2 then t1

and checks that we report the deadlock in the events log of the db
allowing us to identify the two deadlocking transactions, thus the 
sql stmts in those transactions, by means of their cnonce. Notice
that transactions will deadlock in the master node, and the sql 
will be logged in the replicant nodes, thus one would need to find
the sql stmts in replicant node by using cnonce retrieved from 
transaction cnonce on master node.


Eventlog for the deadlock loop will appear only if setting is turned on:
  on print_deadlock_cycles

Eventlog entry will look like this:

{"time": 1499873882991794,"host": "node1","deadlock_cycle": [{"cnonce": "8323329-27057-959039-1013043383","lid": "0x80000012","lcount": 5},{"cnonce": "8323329-27056-958938-1013043383","lid": "0x80000010","lcount": 5,"victim": true}]}
