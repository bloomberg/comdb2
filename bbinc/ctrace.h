/* use this to create /bb/data/taskname.trc.c and write printf
   comments.  ie, ctrace("big bug at line %d",__LINE__);

   The following environment variables can be used:-

   BBTRCLOG_ROLLAT=#, <TASKNAME>_TRCLOG_ROLLAT=#
    - the ctrace api will automatically roll the log file using the
      newoccurence script when it exceeds # bytes in size

   Note that the auto-rollat feature is not thread safe (unless
   ctrace_enable_threading() is called, see below), so only single threaded
   clients can currently use it.

   BBTRCLOG_WARNAT=#, <TASKNAME>s_TRCLOG_WARNAT=#
    - the ctrace api will warn when it opens the log file if it
      exceeds the size given.

   If BBTRCLOG_WARNAT or <TASKNAME>s_TRCLOG_WARNAT are not in the environment
   then the ctrace api will warn if the log file is larger than 1GB when
   it opens it.

/* Enable locking, this should be called before any other ctrace api calls.
   This makes the auto-roll (ie rollat) feature safe in multithreaded
   applications.

   The rest of the ctrace api is relatively threadsafe so it
   isn't strictly necessary for a multithreaded application to call this unless
   it wants to safely use that feature, but it doesn't really hurt (under the
   hood the logging calls will contend over a file lock anyway).
   Similarly it isn't necessary to call this in a singly threaded application
   (or an application where only one thread uses ctrace), but it's not going to
   hurt anything.
