  Tunable types

  * TUNABLE_INTEGER
    The tunables of this type, by default, allow all numbers >= 0.
    NOZERO bit can be set to allow all values > 0. The range can be
    extended by setting SIGNED bit to allow positive as well as
    negative values.

  * TUNABLE_DOUBLE
    The tunable, by default, accepts all real numbers >= 0. Like,
    TUNABLE_INTEGER zeros can be disallowed by setting NOZERO bit
    and, similarly, range can be extended by setting SIGNED bit.

  * TUNABLE_BOOLEAN
    The tunable can accept boolean values (0, 1, off, on).

  * TUNABLE_STRING
    The tunable can accept string as value.

  * TUNABLE_ENUM
    The tunable can accept only a limited set of strings. This can be
    done by defining the 'update' function pointer for the tunable.
