#ifndef INCLUDED_LOCKMACROS

/*
 * LOCK MACROS FOR PTHREAD_MUTEX_LOCK
 *
 * These allow you to enclose locked sections of code within compound
 * statements.  For example:
 *
 * pthread_mutex_t lock = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;
 * LOCK(&lock) {
 *   // do stuff under lock
 * } UNLOCK(&lock);
 *
 * rather than:
 *
 * pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
 * // do stuff under lock
 * pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
 *
 *
 * By enclosing the lock portion within a compound statement you gain a degree
 * of static checking (the compiler will complain if you have a LOCK() without
 * a corresponding UNLOCK()).  Also, these macros check the result of the
 * pthread mutex functions.
 *
 * If you like, these provide the poor man's C equivalent of C++ scoped lock
 * guards.
 *
 * Paul was the original author of this file.
 *
 *
 * April 2011 - Sam Jervis altered this module to use the assert_pthread_mutex_
 * wrappers, altering the behaviour so that if a lock acquisition fails the
 * program will abort rather than blindly carry on.  This should be ok -
 * carrying on regardless will likely just corrupt memory (as things which
 * should be accessed exclusively end up getting accessed simultaneously
 * by multiple threads), leading to a bigger mess later on.
 * Note that as a side effect of this change, using these macros will also
 * alter the errno variable.
