/* String reference class:
 *
 * Allows for multiple pointers to point to the same 'str' object
 * by means of counting references to 'this' object.
 *
 * NOTE: avoid assigning an object of this class to another explicitly,
 * as that can result in violating the correct counting! 
 * Instead, use transfer_ref(), or use get_ref() which increments the counter
 * and returns a reference to 'this'.
 *
 * NOTE: One use case of this class is to ref count object passed to another thread, in
 * which case: when passing a pointer to this class to a function or to another thread,
 * it has to be clear that only one of the copies should ultimately call put_ref().
 * For instance, in the case of passing to a thread, the thread takes over ownership
 * of the pointer (and needs to put_ref() accordingly).
 *
 * Releasing the reference should be only done via put_ref() which will free the object
 * if reference has reached count of 0. Notice that no other pointer to 'this' should
 * exist when correctly used because this is the last put_ref() and no other pointer
 * points to this object.
 *
