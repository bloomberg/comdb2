Im not completely sure that we want to do the 'blocking' version of this code..
there is a problem with it 

new tunables:
   physrep_write tunable allows writes through physical replicants: verify that you can't write if 
   this is disabled
   physrep_write_wait_commit: if set, the writer will pause until the commit-lsn propogates to this physrep
   physrep_commit_timeout: max time that physrep will wait for a commit record- we default this to 0, which is 
      indefinitely .. 
      need to think about this a bit: I'm worried that the commit record will never arrive.. but this
      is probably a bit overblown .. we could return both the generation and the lsn of the committing
      record and block until either the generation is larger, or the lsn is larger .. i dont want to 
      belabor this too much, as it prolly wont happen that much 
   physrep_long_write_threshold: just prints a message if a physrep waits a long time for something to
      replicate
   physrep_poll_ms: query the cluster

we need to test on different architectures: we can start with the truncatesc test- what is the behavior
if the physical replicant is sitting on a sun, and the db is on linux?  what about the other way around?
