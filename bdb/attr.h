/*
  BDB_ATTR_REPTIMEOUT
     amount of time to wait for acks.  when the time is exceeded,
     the transaction will proceed without the cooperation of the
     faulting node.  the routine registered in
     bdb_register_reptimeout_rtn will be called.  the application
     should take whatever action is needed to maintain cache
     coherency requirements.
  BDB_ATTR_CHECKPOINTTIME
     number of seconds between checkpoints.  checkpoints are needed
     to apply records from the log files to the database files.  log
     files can only be removed once they have been applied to the
     database files.  checkpoints occur in a separate thread.  i
     currently do not know the real performance impact of running a
     checkpoint during database update activity.  this is also the
     timer used for deletion of log files.
  BDB_ATTR_LOGFILESIZE
     size in bytes of a log file.  log files are extented until they
     reach BDB_ATTR_LOGFILESIZE, then a new log file is created
     with an extension of .N+1 if the previous log file was .N
  BDB_ATTR_LOGMEMSIZE
     this buffer is used when BDB_ATTR_SYNCTRANSACTIONS is set to 0.
     commits will not cause the log file to be flushed to stable
     storage.  the log file will be flushed only when this memory
     buffer fills.  when BDB_ATTR_SYNCTRANSACTIONS is set to 1, this
     buffer is used as temorary storage between the bdb_tran_begin
     phase and the bdb_tran_commit phase.
  BDB_ATTR_LOGDELETEAGE
     log files that are both no longer needed (no longer needed means
     that all data in the log file has been succesfully applied to
     the local database file.  the definition of no longer needed
     is not currently extended to know anything about replication)
     and are older than BDB_ATTR_LOGDELETEAGE seconds will be
     deleted.  the deletion attempt happens on the checkpoint
     interval, immediately following a checkpoint.  two special
     values exist.  LOGDELETEAGE_NEVER means never delete log files.
     LOGDELETEAGE_NOW means immediately remove any unneeded log file.
     the full range of positive integers >=0 are avaiable to the
     application.
  BDB_ATTR_SYNCTRANSACTIONS
     when this attribute is set to 1, a call to bdb_tran_commit()
     will cause the log files to be syncronously flushed before
     control returns to the application.  when this attribute is
     set to 0, control will return to the application as soon as
     the transaction is reflected in cache.
  BDB_ATTR_CACHESIZE
     the size in kbytes of the cache to be used for all databases
     associated with the bdb_handle.  this cache is shared.
  BDB_ATTR_CREATEDBS
     when this attribute is set to 1, the bdb library will create
     and initialize any on disk structures as needed.  when this
     attribute is set to 0, the bdb library will make no such
     attempt.
  BDB_ATTR_FULLRECOVERY
     if this attribute is set to 1, we run full recovery in bdb_open.
     this is NECESSARY the first time a new site is brought into
     a replication group via a live copy of the current database.
     this should not be needed in other cases (perhaps necessary
     as an integrity check)
  BDB_ATTR_RRNCACHESIZE
     this is the number of rrn records from the freerec db that stay in
     memory for fast rrn allocation
  BDB_ATTR_RRNEXTENDAMOUNT
     we add this many records in one batch transaction to the rrn freerec
     db when the freerec is empty
  BDB_ATTR_REPALWAYSWAIT
     when this is set, bdb_wait_for_seqnum_from_all() and
     bdb_wait_for_seqnum_from_node() will wait for nodes that do not have
     an working comm at the moment of the call.  the wait can still succeed
     if the node comes re-estabilishes comm.
  BDB_ATTR_PAGESIZEDTA
     the pagesize of the .dta file
  BDB_ATTR_PAGESIZEFREEREC
     the pagesize of the .freerec file
  BDB_ATTR_PAGESIZEIX
     the pagesize of the .ix[0-n] files
  BDB_ATTR_RRNCACHELOWAT
     try to keep this many rrns in the rrn cache.
  BDB_ATTR_ORDEREDRRNS
     keep rrn allocation sequentially ordered whenever possible
  BDB_ATTR_GENIDS
     do we internally maintain an 8 byte generation id associated with each
     record.
  BDB_ATTR_DELRQUIRESGENIDS
     if we are running in genid mode, do we allow access from clients that
     dont understand genids for DELETE requests.
  BDB_ATTR_UPDATEREQUIRESGENIDS
     if we are running in genid mode, do we allow access from clients that
     dont understand genids for UPDATE requests.
  BDB_ATTR_I_AM_MASTER
     become master on startup, do not elect.
  BDB_ATTR_FREERECQUEUE
     use alternate queue implementation of freerec.  can only be turned on
     if all nodes in the cluster support this.
  BDB_ATTR_REPFAILCHK
     controls replicant check on failure feature:
        OFF: feature is ENABLED
        ON:  feature is DISABLED
  BDB_ATTR_REPFAILCHKTIME
     time frame in seconds where replicant timeout failures are counted
     once time frame is exhausted then count is reset to 0
  BDB_ATTR_REPFAILCHKTHRESH
     # of 'allowed' replicant timeout during a BDB_ATTR_REPFAILCHKTIME
     before we go have a look at what is happening for replicant.
  BDB_ATTR_PANICLOGSNAP
     controls snapshot of last log on panic feature
        OFF: feature is ENABLED
        ON:  feature is DISABLED
  BDB_ATTR_ENABLECURSORSER
     if true bdb_fetch_int() will attempt to use cursor serialization
  BDB_ATTR_ENABLECURSORPAUSE
     if true bdb_cursor will attempt to use cursor pausing

  BDB_ATTR_SOSQL_MAX_COMMIT_WAIT_SEC
     maximum number of seconds we wait for a transaction to commit
     since the last message (OSQL_DONE) was sent to the master

  BDB_ATTR_SOSQL_POKE_TIMEOUT_SEC
     maximum number of seconds we wait since the last confirmed checked
     before we fail the transaction and return SQLHERR_MASTER_TIMEOUT to
     client

  BDB_ATTR_SOSQL_POKE_EVERY_SEC
     minimum number of seconds we wait since last poke before we sent
     one again to the master

  BDB_ATTR_SQL_QUEUEING_DISABLE_TRACE
     disables the Queuing sql trace, which detects sql overload cases

  BDB_ATTR_SQL_QUEUEING_CRITICAL_TRACE
     maximum number of sql queries we can queue without alerting when
     SQL_QUEUEING_DISABLE_TRACE is on

  MASTER_REJECT_SQL_IGNORE_SANC
     normally master rejects sql if there are coherent(connected) nodes that
     are also in the sanc list.
     enabling this check only if there are coherent (connected) nodes before
     rejecting - this breaks with proxies using sanc list as cluster view
