   the remote databasae. Second of all, it is also infeasible
   for a remote database to verify the actual client of
   a remsql request. It'd be possible only if the peer database
   had the client private key. Therefore we decide not to
   support SSL remote SQL, but instead to provide this simple knob
   to permit remote SQL when client SSL is required.
