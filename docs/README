This is Comdb2 documentation.  If you're going to work on it, and want
to preview changes before you commit, you'll need to set up a few
things.  This'll tell you how.

Instructions for Debian-based systems follow.  Instructions for
Redhat-based systems would be welcome.

0) install a sane build environment (sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev)
1) cd docs
2) Install jekyll (sudo apt install jekyll)
3) Start server (jekyll serve --watch --host your_ip --port your_port)

The docs are in pages/*.md. The table of contents on the left is in
_data/sidebars/mydoc_sidebar.yml When you save files, jekyll should
regenerate the docs automatically.  Point your browser at
http://your_ip:your_port to view them.

Images in the docs/images directory are not checked in (except for svg diagrams).  Any svg diagrams were 
done with draw.io, and the source files are in docs/diagrams.  Syntax diagrams are generated by SQLite's
scripts.  To generates those
1) cd docs/src/sqlitegen
2) run ./bubble-generator.tcl (tcl is already a build requirement for Comdb2 and should be present)
3) click the 'Everything' button.
4) kill bubble-generator.tcl after it's done
The program depends on Tk and thus Xlib, so converting it to something that doesn't need X isn't trivial,
and probably isn't worth the time.
