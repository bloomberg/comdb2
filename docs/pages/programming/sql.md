This section defines the syntax of SQL as accepted by Comdb2.  Anyone familiar with [SQLite](http://sqlite.org) 
will find the syntax diagrams familiar. Comdb2 uses SQLite as the query parser and query planner.  The SQL dialects 
in Comdb2 and SQLite are not identical however.  Some things have been taken away (DDL syntax is different, 
```OR REPLACE``` clauses are gone), and some have been added (stored procedures, time partitions).

## Transactions

### BEGIN

![BEGIN](images/begin-stmt.gif)

Begin a transaction. The impact of this changes somewhat based on the sessions transaction level 
([```SET TRANSACTION```](#set-transaction)).  See the [transaction model](transaction_model.html) 
section for lots of details about available isolation levels.  Quick summary follows.

In the default level (when no ```SET TRANSACTION``` statement has been run, and no defaults set 
in the database configuration file) this statement has the effect of beginning a transaction which 
will block all *write* operations together transactionally. *Read* operations will not run transactionally, 
and thus will not see the results of intermediate operations within a transaction (prior to commit.)

In Read Committed level (```SET TRANSACTION READ COMMITTED```) this statement has the effect of beginning a 
transaction that will group all *read* and *write* operations into a transaction. "Reads" will see 
results of intermediate operations within a transaction. Long term read locks will not be held, and reads 
are not "repeatable."

In Snapshot Isolation level (```SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT ISOLATION```) this statement has the effect of 
beginning a transaction that will group all *read* and *write* operations into a transaction. *Reads* 
will see results of intermediate operations within a transaction. Reads are repeatable in this mode 
without the use of long term read locks through the use of Multi Version Concurrency Control. This level 
also guarantees lack of phantoms. Before using snapshot isolation, you must add enable_snapshot_isolation 
to your lrl file.

**NOTE**: if any SQL statements inside the transaction fail, excluding [```COMMIT```](#commit), the application 
needs to run [```ROLLBACK```](#rollback) before it's able to reuse the same connection for other requests.  A 
transaction that calls ```COMMIT``` or ```ROLLBACK``` is considered complete, regardless of any errors returned.
The next statement that runs on the same connection will be in a new transaction.

The optional AS OF DATETIME clause begins a transaction with a snapshot of the database as it existing as of the given time. The snapshot only has the effects of transactions that committed before that time. Using AS OF DATETIME requires the transaction being in SNAPSHOT ISOLATION mode (set with SET TRANSACTION SNAPSHOT ISOLATION). Note that enabling SNAPSHOT ISOLATION requires the enable_snapshot_isolation lrl tunable. Snapshots requested from before snapshot isolation was enabled will not work. A snapshot is only available if enough transaction logs are online to find commits before the specified time.


### COMMIT

![COMMIT](images/commit-stmt.gif)

Commits a transaction previously started with [```BEGIN```](#begin). The effect of this call will be to submit all 
"write" operations that were part of the transaction to the db engine to be performed as a transaction. At this point 
all constraints will be verified, and cascade operations will be performed if required.  Any errors in [*deferred*
statements](transaction_model.html#immediate-and-deferred-statements) will be returned at this point.  Any transaction 
where ```COMMIT``` returns an error is considered rolled back. It is an error to call ```COMMIT``` on a connection 
where no transaction has been started with ```BEGIN```.

### ROLLBACK

![ROLLBACK](images/rollback-stmt.gif)

Rolls back (aka *aborts*) the current transaction.  Any effects of previous statements in the current transaction are
undone.

## Changing data

### INSERT

![INSERT](images/insert-stmt.gif)

The ```INSERT``` statement comes in two basic forms. The first form (with the "VALUES" keyword) creates a single new 
row in an existing table. If no column-list is specified then the number of values must be the same as the number 
of columns in the table. If a column-list is specified, then the number of values must match the number of 
specified columns. Columns of the table that do not appear in the column list are filled with the default value, 
or with NULL if no default value is specified.

The second form of the ```INSERT``` statement takes its data from a ```SELECT``` statement. The number of columns in the 
result of the SELECT must exactly match the number of columns in the table if no column list is specified, or it 
must match the number of columns named in the column list. A new entry is made in the table for every row of the 
```SELECT``` result. The ```SELECT``` may be simple or compound.

Note that if wrapped in a ```BEGIN```/```COMMIT``` pair, the ```INSERT``` is considered a [deferred](transaction_model.html#immediate-and-deferred-statements)
statement, and will not return an error (except in the rare case of a connection failure) until ```COMMIT``` time.

[select-stmt](#select-statement)

### UPDATE

![UPDATE](images/update-stmt-limited.gif)

The UPDATE statement is used to change the value of columns in selected rows of a table. Each assignment in an 
```UPDATE``` specifies a column name to the left of the equals sign and an arbitrary expression to the right. 
The expressions may use the values of other columns. All expressions are evaluated before any assignments are 
made. A ```WHERE``` clause can be used to restrict which rows are updated.

[with-clause](#with-clause)

[qualified-table-name](#qualified-table-name)

[expr](#expr)

### DELETE

![DELETE](images/delete-stmt-limited.gif)

The ```DELETE``` command is used to remove records from a table. The command consists of the ```DELETE FROM``` 
keywords followed by the name of the table from which records are to be removed.  

If the ```WHERE``` clause is omitted, all rows will be deleted.  Note that in this case, the ```DELETE``` statement
will traverse all rows and remove them individually.  This makes it a less efficient option than the ```TRUNCATE```
statement, but has the advantage that it will work on tables with foreign key constraints.

## Querying data

### SELECT statement

![SELECT](images/select-stmt.gif)

#### Select syntax overview
The ```SELECT``` statement is used to query the database. The result of a ```SELECT``` is zero or more rows of 
data where each row has a fixed number of columns. The number of columns in the result is specified by the 
expression list in between the ```SELECT``` and ```FROM``` keywords. Any arbitrary expression can be used as a 
result. If a result expression is * then all columns of all tables are substituted for that one expression. If 
the expression is the name of a table followed by .* then the result is all columns in that one table.

<a id="SELECTV"/>
The SELECTV variant of ```SELECT``` operates exactly the same as ```SELECT``` and supports exactly the same syntax. 
The difference is ```SELECTV``` causes Comdb2 to *assert* that the rows visited during the ```SELECTV``` remain 
unchanged at the time of a COMMIT. It can be used in a similar manner to the ```SELECT FOR UPDATE``` construct 
provided by other systems.  Note that ```SELECTV``` can only be used in the following transactional modes: default, 
[```READ COMMITTED```](transaction_model.html#read-committed-isolation-level) and 
[```SNAPSHOT ISOLATION```](transaction_model.html#snapshot-isolation-level). ```READ COMMITTED``` is the recommended 
mode for running ```SELECTV```; we allow ```SELECTV``` in the default mode, but there are corner cases inherent to this isolation level in which the
transactions will fail, therefore ```SELECTV``` in the default mode is not recommended. ```SELECTV``` works properly 
in ```SNAPSHOT ISOLATION```, but use ```READ COMMITTED``` unless your transactions are already running in 
```SNAPSHOT ISOLATION``` (it is slightly more expensive to run in ```SNAPSHOT ISOLATION``` than 
```READ COMMITTED``` transactions).

<a id="DISTINCT"/>
The ```DISTINCT``` keyword causes a subset of result rows to be returned, in which each result row is different. 
```NULL``` values are not treated as distinct from each other. The default behavior is that all result rows be 
returned, which can be made explicit with the keyword ```ALL```.

The query is executed against one or more tables specified after the ```FROM``` keyword. If multiple tables names are 
separated by commas, then the query is against the cross join of the various tables. The full SQL-92 join syntax 
can also be used to specify joins. A sub-query in parentheses may be substituted for any table name in the ```FROM``` 
clause. The entire FROM clause may be omitted, in which case the result is a single row consisting of the values of the expression list.

<a id="WHERE"/>
The ```WHERE``` clause can be used to limit the number of rows over which the query operates.

<a id="GROUPBY"/>
The ```GROUP BY``` clause causes one or more rows of the result to be combined into a single row of output. This is 
especially useful when the result contains aggregate functions. The expressions in the ```GROUP BY``` clause do not 
have to be expressions that appear in the result. The ```HAVING``` clause is similar to ```WHERE``` except 
that ```HAVING``` applies after grouping has occurred. The ```HAVING``` expression may refer to values, even 
aggregate functions, that are not in the result.

<a id="ORDERBY"/>
The ```ORDER BY``` clause causes the output rows to be sorted. The argument to ```ORDER BY``` is a list of 
expressions that are used as the key for the sort. The expressions do not have to be part of the result for 
a simple ```SELECT```, but in a compound ```SELECT``` each sort expression must exactly match one of the 
result columns. Each sort expression may be optionally followed by a ```COLLATE``` keyword and the name of a 
collating function used for ordering text and/or keywords ```ASC``` or ```DESC``` to specify the sort order. 
Note that in the absence of an ```ORDER BY``` clause the order in which rows are returned is not defined.

Each term of an ```ORDER BY``` BY expression is processed as follows:

If the ```ORDER BY``` expression is a constant integer K then the output is ordered by the K-th column of the 
result set.

If the ```ORDER BY``` expression is an identifier and one of the output columns as an alias by the same name, 
then the output is ordered by the identified column.

Otherwise, the ```ORDER BY``` expression is evaluated and the output is ordered by the value of that expression.

In a compound ```SELECT``` statement, the third ```ORDER BY``` matching rule requires that the expression be 
identical to one of the columns in the result set. The three rules are first applied to the left-most ```SELECT``` in 
the compound. If a match is found, the search stops. Otherwise, the next ```SELECT``` to the right is tried. This 
continues until a match is found. Each term of the ```ORDER BY``` clause is processed separately and may come 
from different ```SELECT``` statements in the compound.

<a id="LIMIT"/>
The ```LIMIT``` clause places an upper bound on the number of rows returned in the result. A negative ```LIMIT``` 
indicates no upper bound. The optional ```OFFSET``` following ```LIMIT``` specifies how many rows to skip at the 
beginning of the result set. In a compound query, the ```LIMIT``` clause may only appear on the final ```SELECT``` 
statement. The limit is applied to the entire query not to the individual ```SELECT``` statement to which it is 
attached. Note that if the ```OFFSET``` keyword is used in the ```LIMIT``` clause, then the limit is the first 
number and the offset is the second number. If a comma is used instead of the ```OFFSET``` keyword, then the 
offset is the first number and the limit is the second number. This seeming contradiction is intentional - it 
maximizes compatibility with legacy SQL database systems.

<a id="UNION"/>
A compound ```SELECT``` is formed from two or more simple ```SELECT``` statements connected by one of the 
operators ```UNION```, ```UNION ALL``` , ```INTERSECT```, or ```EXCEPT```. In a compound ```SELECT```, all the 
constituent ```SELECT``` statements must specify the same number of result columns. There may be only a 
single ```ORDER BY``` clause at the end of the compound ```SELECT```. The ```UNION``` and ```UNION ALL``` 
operators combine the results of the ```SELECT``` statements to the right and left into a single big table. 
The difference is that in ```UNION``` all result rows are distinct where in ```UNION ALL``` there may be 
duplicates. The ```INTERSECT``` operator takes the intersection of the results of the left and right ```SELECT```
statements. ```EXCEPT``` takes the result of left ```SELECT``` after removing the results of the right ```SELECT```. 
When three or more ```SELECT``` statements are connected into a compound statement, they group from left to right.

#### Foreign tables
Tables specified in [table-or-subquery](#table-or-subquery) clause may refer to tables in other databases. The 
syntax is simply ```database.tablename```.  Being able to locate the ```database``` requires setting up 
[comdb2db](clients.html#comdb2db). For simple setups/testing the application can 
specify ```LOCAL_database.tablename``` to refer to a table in a database that's running on the same machine as 
the database receiving the query.  One can create an alias to a foreign table and refer to it as if
it's in a local database, see the [```PUT ALIAS```](#put) statement.  This has the advantage of being able to move
tables between databases without changing SQL statements used to query them.

## Stored procedures

### CREATE PROCEDURE

![CREATE PROCEDURE](images/create-proc.gif)

The ```CREATE PROCEDURE``` statement defines a new procedure.  Procedures can be run directly with the 
```EXEC PROCEDURE``` statement. Defined procedures can also be registered as new SQL functions with the
[CREATE LUA FUNCTION](#create-lua-function) statement, or as triggers with ```CREATE LUA TRIGGER```/
```CREATE LUA CONSUMER``` statements.

Procedures can be given versions.  Version names are to be supplied by the user.  Versioning allows a more
compartmentalized development model.  For instance, users may have "beta" and "prod" versions of a procedure
to be run from different deployment stages. The [SET SPVERSION](#set-spversion) statement can specify the
version to use for the current connection.  The first version added for a new procedure automatically becomes a 
default. Adding a new version does not make it the default - it must be made the new default version with with 
the [```PUT DEFAULT PROCEDURE```](#put) statement.  

For detailed information on writing stored procedures, see the [stored procedures](storedprocs.html) section.

### EXEC PROCEDURE

![exec procedure](images/exec-procedure.gif)

Runs the stored procedure named by procedure-name.  Procedures can take literal or bound parameter arguments.
Stored procedure calls are [immediate](transaction_model.html#immediate-and-deferred-statements) statements.

## Creating and altering entities

### CREATE TABLE

**CREATE TABLE (I):**

![CREATE TABLE](images/create-table.gif)

**CREATE TABLE (II, Version R7 and above):**

![CREATE TABLE](images/create-table-ddl.gif)

**Index column list:**

![INDEX COLUMN LIST](images/index-column-list.gif)

**Column constraint:**

![COLUMN CONSTRAINT](images/column-constraint.gif)

**Table constraint:**

![TABLE CONSTRAINT](images/table-constraint.gif)

**Foreign key definition:**

![FOREIGN KEY DEFINITION](images/foreign-key-def.gif)

**Table options:**

![TABLE OPTIONS](images/table-options.gif)

The ```CREATE TABLE``` statement creates a new table. If the table already
exists, the statement returns an error unless the ```IF NOT EXISTS``` clause
is present.

Comdb2 supports two variants of ```CREATE TABLE``` syntax. In the first approach,
the schema definition defines all keys and constraints (more information can be
found on the [table schema](table_schema.html) page).

The second approach, added in **version R7**, follows the usual standard data
definition language syntax supported by other relational database systems.
A primary key created using ```CREATE TABLE (II)``` implicitly creates a
```UNIQUE``` index named ```COMDB2_PK``` with all key columns marked
```NOT NULL```.

See also:

[table-schema](table_schema.html)

### CREATE LUA TRIGGER

![CREATE TRIGGER](images/create-trigger.gif)

Creates a new trigger or consumer to be called for specified table events.  See the [Triggers](triggers.html) 
section for a full explanation and examples.  Briefly, triggers are run by the database when a matching table 
event occurs.  They do not return data to the client, but may create/modify records. A common application of 
triggers is to create an audit table that logs record changes. Consumers register with the database the 
intent to listen for matching table changes. Consumers may then call the stored procedure with the given name 
to block and receive matching events when they occur.

Procedure-name must be a name of an existing Lua procedure created with a
[```CREATE PROCEDURE```](#create-procedure) statement.

See also:

[table-event](#table-event)


### CREATE LUA FUNCTION

![CREATE LUA FUNCTION](images/create-lua-func.gif)

This registers a stored procedure with the list of functions known by the SQL engine. This allows the function
to be called from running SQL statements like [built-in SQL functions](#built-in-sql-functions).  The ```SCALAR``` 
keyword specifies that the function will return a single value given a set of arguments, eg: like the built-in
function ```UPPER```.  The ```AGGREGATE``` keyword specifies that the function will return a single value from a
subset of rows, like the built-in function ```SUM```.

### DROP

![DROP TABLE](images/drop.gif)

```DROP``` will delete the specified entity from the database.

```DROP TABLE``` will drop the specified table.  If the table doesn't exist, the statement will return an error,
unless ```IF EXISTS``` is specified.

```DROP PROCEDURE``` will drop the specified version on a procedure.  See the [stored procedure](storedprocs.html)
section for details.

```DROP LUA TRIGGER```, ```DROP LUA CONSUMER```, ```DROP LUA SCALAR FUNCTION``` and ```DROP LUA AGGREGATE FUNCTION```
will drop the association between a stored procedure and the trigger/consumer/function that it maps to.  The trigger
will no longer fire.  All SQL connections running the consumer procedure will stop with an error.  The named functions
will no longer be callable from SQL.

### ALTER TABLE

**ALTER TABLE (I):**

![ALTER](images/alter-table.gif)

**ALTER TABLE (II, Version R7 and above):**

![ALTER](images/alter-table-ddl.gif)

_**Schema changes in Comdb2 are live by default**. The database will not acquire
long duration table locks during the change and may be freely read from and
written to.  If the schema change adds a new field, or grows the size of an
existing field, and doesn't modify the table keys, the change is "*instant*"
(unless the ```ISC``` table option is set to ```OFF```). No table rebuild will
take place (unless the table option ```REBUILD``` is specified) if it's not
needed. If fields are removed or the size of an existing field is reduced, the
schema change will need to rebuild the existing table. If any key is modified,
it'll be rebuilt._

The ```ALTER TABLE``` statement will change the definition of the named table
to the one provided. Note that Comdb2 supports two variants of ```ALTER TABLE```
syntax.

The first approach uses a [declarative language](table_schema.html) and is not
incremental like SQL. In this approach there is no need to alter the table
multiple times to add several indices. The ```ALTER TABLE``` statement will try
to form the most efficient to change the old table definition to the new one.
Any fields present in the new schema but absent from the old will be added to
the table definition. Any fields absent in the new schema but present int the
old will be dropped. Keys will be added, renamed or changed. Constraints will
be added or removed. See the [Schema definition](table_schema.html) section for
details on the table schema definition syntax. See the [table options](#table-options)
section a list of options that may be set for a table.

The second approach, added in **version R7**, supports the usual standard data
definition language, like other relational database systems. This syntax can
be used to ```ADD``` a new column or ```DROP``` an existing column from the
table. Multiple ADD/DROP operations can be used in the same command. In case of
```DROP``` operation, the references to the column being dropped will be
silently removed from the referring keys and constraints definitions. ```RENAME TO```
option renames a table.  This option cannot be combined with other ```ALTER TABLE```
options.

See also:

[table-options](#table-options)

### CREATE TIME PARTITION

![create-time-partition](images/create-time-part.gif)

```CREATE TIME PARTITION``` defines the data retention policy for the given table. See [Time-based Table Partitioning](timepart.html)

### TRUNCATE

![TRUNCATE](images/truncate.gif)

The ```TRUNCATE``` statement deletes all the data in a give table.  It does this very efficiently by creating
a brand new table and telling the database to use it instead of the old table.  For anything but very small tables
this is much more efficient than using the [```DELETE``` statement](#delete).  However ```TRUNCATE``` will refuse
to operate on tables that have foreign key constraints, or are referred to by tables with foreign key constraints.
This restriction is necessary since it's not possible to quickly verify that no constraints are violated.  If all
records need to be deleted from a table with/referenced by foreign key constrains, please use the ```DELETE``` 
statement instead.

### CREATE INDEX

![CREATE INDEX](images/create-index.gif)

The ```CREATE INDEX``` statement can be used to create an index on an existing
table. The support for ```CREATE INDEX``` was added in version 7.0.

### DROP INDEX

![DROP INDEX](images/drop-index.gif)

The ```DROP INDEX``` statement can be used to drop an existing index. A ```DROP
INDEX``` command without ```ON``` will drop an index with the specified name.
It, however, would fail if there are multiple indexes in the database with the
same name. The support for ```DROP INDEX``` was added in version 7.0.

## Access control

### GRANT and REVOKE

![GRANT and REVOKE](images/grant-revoke.gif)

```GRANT``` lets the named user have read or write access to the given table. ```REVOKE``` takes away that access.
Note that the access checks aren't enforced until authentication is enabled on the database as a whole with the
[```PUT AUTHENTICATION```](#put) statement.

```GRANT OP TO``` gives superuser privileges to a given user.  That user can create/drop tables and grant/revoke
privileges to other users.

## Database settings

### GET

![GET](images/get.gif)

```GET``` allows access to persistent database settings that are changed/enabled with the [```PUT```](#put) statement.  Not
all settings are gettable - passwords aren't for example, for obvious reasons.  There are many other database settings
that are not exposed to the ```GET```/```PUT``` statement yet, but should be over time.

The settings currently available to ```GET``` are:

  * ```ALIAS``` - fetch the local alias name for a table in another database, see [foreign tables](#foreign-tables)
  * ```ANALYZE COVERAGE``` and ```ANALYZE THRESHOLD``` - fetch tunables used to configure index statistics gathering,
    see the [```ANALYZE```](#analyze) statement.

### PUT

![PUT](images/put.gif)

This is the counterpart to the ```GET``` statement.  ```PUT``` changes persistent database settings.  If authentication
is enabled with ```PUT AUTHENTICATION ON```, only superusers can run ```PUT``` commands.

The settings currently available to ```PUT``` are:

  * ```ANALYZE COVERAGE``` and ```ANALYZE THRESHOLD``` - set tunables used to configure index statistics gathering,
    see the [```ANALYZE```](#analyze) statement.
  * ```DEFAULT PROCEDURE``` - sets the default version for a given stored procedure.  Calls to the stored procedure
    without a ```SET SPDEFAULT``` statement will run this version.  See [stored procedures](storedprocs.html) for
    and overview.
  * ```ALIAS``` - creates local alias for a [foreign table](#foreign-tables)
  * ```PASSWORD``` - sets a password for a given user.  ```PUT PASSWORD OFF``` disables the user.
  * ```AUTHENTICATION``` - enables/disables authentication on the database.  If enabled, access checks are performed.
    Note that a user must be designated as a superuser before enabling authentication.
  * ```TIME PARTITION``` - changes the [time partition](timepart.html) configuration; only increasing retention is supported currently

## Operational commands

### ANALYZE

![ANALYZE](images/analyze.gif)

```ANALYZE``` scans indices to gather statistics used in forming query plans.  It's important that ```ANALYZE``` runs
every time there are index changes or large data changes.  If the current data disagrees with statistics gathered
from the last ```ANALYZE``` run, the database may form sub-optimal (or outright poor) query plans.

```ANALYZE``` can run on all the tables if ```ALL``` is specified, or on a single given table.  The latter makes sense
when rebuilding statistics after index/data changes to a single table.  Analyze runs in 2 stages

  1. Database scans each index and builds a "*summary*" - it saves a percentage of the original data to compute 
     statistics for. ```percent-coverage``` (integer from 1-100) configures the percentage of data to be analyzed.
     The default value can be configured with [```PUT ANALYZE COVERAGE```](#put).
  2. Database scans the generated summary and computes
     * The selectivity of each index
     * A histogram of values

  Running ```ANALYZE``` on a large table is relatively expensive.  There are some cost/time trade-offs that can
  be set.  For the most accurate data, set ```percent-coverage``` to 100 (default is 10). To speed up the process,
  increase the number threads.  ```OPTIONS THREAD``` configures how many tables to run in parallel (if ```ALL```) is
  specified.  ```OPTIONS SUMMARIZE``` configures how many threads to use for running the first stage described above.

### REBUILD

![REBUILD](images/rebuild.gif)

```REBUILD``` will recreate an existing index, data, or blob, preserving old data.  There are a couple of reasons run
ever run ```REBUILD```:

  * Lots of data has been deleted, and we don't anticipate adding a similar amount back.  Run ```REBUILD``` to 
    reclaim disk space.
  * A table option (like compression) has been set, and we'd like to apply it to existing records immediately. 
  * A table/index/blob is found to be corrupt.

The ```READONLY``` and ```PAGEORDER``` options are intended for the rare cases that a table is found to be corrupt.
Setting the ```READONLY``` option will cause the cluster to drop to ```READONLY``` mode for the duration of the
rebuild.  Traversing a B-Tree in ```PAGEORDER``` requires that the ```READONLY``` flag is set.

## Built-in functions

Most of these functions come straight from SQLite.  Not all SQLite functions are available - datetime functions
are different, for example.  Consult the table below for a list.  New functions may be created with
[```CREATE LUA FUNCTION```](#create-lua-function).

### Available functions

|Function                          | Description                                                                  |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|abs(X)                            | <a id="abs"/> Return the absolute value of the numeric argument X. Return NULL if X is NULL. Return 0.0 if X is not a numeric value.                                |
|char(X1,X2,...,XN)                | <a id="char"/> Return a string composed of characters having the unicode code point values of integers X1 through XN, respectively. |
|coalesce(X,Y,...)                 | <a id="coalesce"/> Return a copy of the first non-NULL argument. If all arguments are NULL then NULL is returned. There must be at least 2 arguments. |
|comdb2_version()                  | <a id="comdb2_version"/> Return a string that describes the version of the software. It has a format "release (version)", eg: "R5 (v97966)" Supported in R5 since v93297 and R4 since v95511. If your database is running versions older than this, the function won't be available. |
|comdb2_prevquerycost()            | <a id="comdb2_prevquerycost"/> Return a string that describes the cost of the last query run on this connection. Requires a ```SET GETCOST ON``` is run on the connection first.
|ifnull(X,Y)                       | <a id="ifnull"/> Return a copy of the first non-NULL argument. If both arguments are NULL then NULL is returned. This behaves the same as |
|instr(X,Y)                        | <a id="instr"/> Find the first occurrence of string Y within string X and returns the number of prior characters plus 1, or 0 if Y is nowhere found within X. Or, if X and Y are both BLOBs, then return one more than the number bytes prior to the first occurrence of Y, or 0 if Y does not occur anywhere within X. If both arguments X and Y are non-NULL and are not BLOBs then both are interpreted as strings. If either X or Y are NULL then the result is NULL. |
|glob(X,Y)                         | <a id="glob"/> Equivalent to the expression "Y GLOB X". |
|hex(X)                            | <a id="hex"/> The argument is interpreted as a BLOB. The result is a hexadecimal rendering of the content of that blob. |
|length(X)                         | <a id="length"/> Return the string length of X in characters. If configured to support UTF-8, then the number of UTF-8 characters is returned, not the number of bytes. |
|like(X, Y) <br/> like(X,Y,Z)      | <a id="like"/>Equivalent to the expression "Y LIKE X", or "Y LIKE X ESCAPE Z". |
|lower(X)                          | <a id="lower"/>Return a copy of input string X converted to all lower-case letters. The implementation of this function uses the C library routine tolower() which means it may not work correctly on non-ASCII UTF-8 strings. |
|trim(X) <br/> ltrim(X, Y)         | <a id="trim"/>Return a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from the left side of X. If the Y argument is omitted, removes spaces from the left side of X. |
|max(X,Y,...)                      | <a id="max"/>Return the argument with the maximum value. Arguments may be strings in addition to numbers. The maximum value is determined by the usual sort order. Note that max() is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but converts to an aggregate function if given only a single argument. |
|min(X,Y,...)                      | <a id="min"/>Return the argument with the minimum value. Arguments may be strings in addition to numbers. The minimum value is determined by the usual sort order. Note that min() is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but converts to an aggregate function if given only a single argument. |
|nullif(X,Y)                       | <a id="nullif"/>Return the first argument if the arguments are different, otherwise return NULL. |
|printf(FORMAT,...)                | <a id="printf"/>Works like the printf() function from the standard C library. The first argument is a format string that specifies how to construct the output string using values taken from subsequent arguments. If the FORMAT argument is missing or NULL then the result is NULL. The %n format is silently ignored and does not consume an argument. The %p format is an alias for %X. The %z format is interchangeable with %s. If there are too few arguments in the argument list, missing arguments are assumed to have a NULL value, which is translated into 0 or 0.0 for numeric formats or an empty string for %s. |
|quote(X)                          | <a id="quote"/>This routine returns a string which is the value of its argument suitable for inclusion into another SQL statement. Strings are surrounded by single-quotes with escapes on interior quotes as needed. BLOBs are encoded as hexadecimal literals. |
|random()                          | <a id="random"/>Return a pseudo-random integer between -9223372036854775808 and +9223372036854775807. |
|randomblob(N)                     | <a id="randomblob"/>Return an N-byte blob containing pseudo-random bytes. If N is less than 1 then a 1-byte random blob is returned. Hint: applications can generate globally unique identifiers using this function together with hex() and/or lower() like this: hex(randomblob(16)) OR: lower(hex(randomblob(16))) |
|replace(X,Y,Z)                    | <a id="replace"/>Return a string formed by substituting string Z for every occurrence of string Y in string X. If Y is an empty string then return X unchanged. If Z is not initially a string, it is cast to a UTF-8 string prior to processing. |
|round(X) <br/> round(X,Y)         | <a id="round"/>Round off the number X to Y digits to the right of the decimal point. If the Y argument is omitted, 0 is assumed. |
|rtrim(X) <br/ >rtrim(X,Y)         | <a id="rtrim"/>Return a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from the right side of X. If the Y argument is omitted, removes spaces from the right side of X. |
|soundex(X)                        | <a id="soundex"/>Compute the soundex encoding of the string X. The string "?000" is returned if the argument is NULL. |
|sqlite_source_id()                | <a id="sqlite_source_id"/>Returns a string that identifies the specific version of the SQLite library source code that was used: the date and time that the source code was checked in followed by the SHA1 hash for that check-in. |
|sqlite_version()                  | <a id="sqlite_version"/>Return the version string for the SQLite library the software is based upon. |
|substr(X, Y, Z> <br/> substr(X,Y) | <a id="substr"/>Return a substring of input string X that begins with the Y-th character and which is Z characters long. If Z is omitted then all character through the end of the string are returned. The left-most character of X is number 1. If Y is negative the the first character of the substring is found by counting from the right rather than the left. If X is string then characters indices refer to actual UTF-8 characters. If X is a BLOB then the indices refer to bytes. |
|trim(X) <br/> trim(X,Y)           | <a id="trim"/>Return a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from both ends of X. If the Y argument is omitted, removes spaces from both ends of X. |
|typeof(X)                         | <a id="typeof"/>Return the type of the expression X. The only return values are "null", "integer", "real", "text", "datetime" and "blob". |
|unicode(X)                        | <a id="unicode"/>Returns the numeric unicode code point corresponding to the first character of the string X. If the argument is not a string then the result is undefined. |
|upper(X)                          | <a id="upper"/>Return a copy of input string X converted to all upper-case letters. The implementation of this function uses the C library routine toupper() which means it may not work correctly on non-ASCII UTF-8 strings. |
|comdb2_version(X)                 | <a id="comdb2_version"/>Return a string that describes the version of the software. It has a format "release (version)", eg: "R5 (v97966)" Supported in R5 since v93297 and R4 since v95511. If your database is running versions older than this, the function won't be available. |
|zeroblob(N)                       | <a id="zeroblob"/>Return a BLOB consisting of N bytes of 0x00. |

### Aggregate functions

In any aggregate function that takes a single argument, that argument can be preceded by the keyword DISTINCT. In such cases, duplicate elements are filtered before being passed into the aggregate function. For example, the function "count(distinct X)" will return the number of distinct values of column X instead of the total number of non-null values in column X.

|Function                                | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|avg(X)                                  | <a id="avg"/>Return the average value of all non-NULL X within a group. String and BLOB values that do not look like numbers are interpreted as 0. The result of avg() is always a floating point value even if all inputs are integers.|
|count(*)                                | <a id="count"/>The first form return a count of the number of times that X is not NULL in a group. The second form (with no argument) returns the total number of rows in the group. |
|max(X)                                  | <a id="max"/>Return the maximum value of all values in the group. The usual sort order is used to determine the maximum. |
|min(X)                                  | <a id="min"/>Return the minimum non-NULL value of all values in the group. The usual sort order is used to determine the minimum. NULL is only returned if all values in the group are NULL. |
|sum(X) <br/> total(X)                   | <a id="sum"/>Return the numeric sum of all non-NULL values in the group. If there are no non-NULL input rows then sum() returns NULL but total() returns 0.0. NULL is not normally a helpful result for the sum of no rows but the SQL standard requires it and most other SQL database engines implement sum() that way so Comdb2 does it in the same way in order to be compatible. The non-standard total() function is provided as a convenient way to work around this design problem in the SQL language.  The result of total() is always a floating point value. The result of sum() is an integer value if all non-NULL inputs are integers. If any input to sum() is neither an integer or a NULL then sum() returns a floating point value which might be an approximation to the true sum.  Sum() will throw an "integer overflow" exception if all inputs are integers or NULL and an integer overflow occurs at any point during the computation. Total() never throws an exception. |
|group_concat(X) <br/> group_concat(X,Y) | <a id="group_concat"/> The group_concat() function returns a string which is the concatenation of all non-NULL values of X. If parameter Y is present then it is used as the separator between instances of X. A comma (",") is used as the separator if Y is omitted. The order of the concatenated elements is arbitrary. |

## SET statements

```SET``` statements set an option that remains in place for the current SQL connection.  They have no effect on other
existing or new connections.  All ```SET``` statements are 
[deferred](transaction_model.html#immediate-and-deferred-statements), even when not in a transaction.  Any error
from specifying an option incorrectly will be returned on the next statement that runs on this connection. All
arguments to ```SET``` following the keywords is treated as a string and is not parsed further.  String arguments
do not need to be quoted. For example, ```SET USER mike``` is correct.  ```SET USER 'mike'``` is not correct.

![SET](images/set-stmt.gif)

### SET TRANSACTION

This sets the current connection's transaction level.  See 
[transaction levels](transaction_model.html#isolation-levels-and-artifacts) for more details

### SET TIMEZONE

Sets the timezone for the current connection.  All datetime values are returned in this timezone.  All timezone
values received from the application without an explicit timezone specified are taken to be from this timezone.
Please see [datetime types](datetime.html) for more information.

### SET DATETIME PRECISION

Sets the default precision of datetime times.  All datetime values are returned with this precision. There are
two options: 

  1. M - sets the precision to milliseconds.  Datetime values are returned with 
     [cdb2_client_datetime_t](datatypes.html#datetime-types) type.
  1. U - sets the precision to microseconds.  Datetime values are returned with 
     [cdb2_client_datetimeus_t](datatypes.html#datetime-types) type.

### SET USER

Sets the username for the current connection.  Must be set if authentication is enabled (see [```PUT```](#put).  

### SET PASSWORD

Sets the password for the current connection.  Must be set if authentication is enabled (see [```PUT```](#put).
Password check is done against the user specified by [```SET USER```](#set-user).

### SET SPVERSION

Sets the version for a given stored procedure name.  This overrides the default version set globally by
[```SET DEFAULT PROCEDURE```](#put)

### SET READONLY

Sets the connection in readonly mode - it will not be able to issue any statements that modify the database.

### SET VERIFYRETRY

Turns transaction retries on or off. See the section on 
[optimistic concurrency control](transaction_model.html#optimistic-concurrency-control) for lots of details. The
short version is that turning this ON makes the database retry transactions on conflict.  Turning it OFF makes the
user retry.

### SET HASQL

Turns on "*high availability*" mode for SQL.  Normally, if a connections is in a transaction, or is receiving rows
from a query, the failure of the current database node will result in an error returned to the user.  If HASQL is on,
the client will keep track of the snapshot start point, of all queries run, and of the current position in the result
set for the latest query.  On node failure, the snapshot will be re-established on a different node, all statements
will be replayed, and the current query will resume where it left off.  This is only available in ```SNAPSHOT``` 
or ```SERIALIZABLE``` transaction isolation levels.

### SET REMOTE

This restricts access to foreign tables on the current connection.  This is useful for tools that can control the
level of access a user has to databases other than the current database.

### SET GETCOST

This allows the application to call comdb2_getprevquerycost() on a connection after running a query.  This function
returns a text description of the paths taken by the query, and the associated cost.  Useful for tooling.

### SET MAXTRANSIZE

This sets the maximum number of operations a transaction will do.  The default limit is 50000.  Every record
added by ```INSERT```, updated by ```UPDATE```, or deleted by ```DELETE``` counts towards this total.  Transactions
that pass the limit are rejected.

### SET PLANNEREFFORT

Sets a tunable that determines how hard the query planner will work to estimate the cost of possible query plans.  The
setting is a number from 1 (least effort, quickly formed plans) to 10 (most effort, possibly better plans).  The 
default setting is 1.

## Common syntax rules

### qualified-table-name

![qualified-table-name](images/qualified-table-name.gif)

### expr

![expr](images/expr.gif)

Comdb2 understands the following binary operators, in order from highest to lowest precedence:

```
||
*    /    %
+    -
<<   >>   &    |
<    <=   >    >=
=    ==   !=   <>   IN
AND   
OR
```

Supported unary prefix operators are these:

```
-    +    ~    NOT
```

The COLLATE operator can be thought of as a unary postfix operator. The COLLATE operator has the highest precedence. It always binds more tightly than any prefix unary operator or any binary operator.

The unary operator ```+``` is a no-op. It can be applied to strings, numbers, or blobs and it always gives as its result the value of the operand.

Note that there are two variations of the equals and not equals operators. Equals can be either ```=``` or ```==```. The non-equals operator can be either ```!=``` or ```<>```. The ```||``` operator is "concatenate" - it joins together the two strings of its operands. The operator ```%``` outputs the remainder of its left operand modulo its right operand.

The result of any binary operator is a numeric value, except for the ```||``` concatenation operator which gives a string result.

A literal value is an integer number or a floating point number. Scientific notation is supported. The ```.``` character is always used as the decimal point. A string constant is formed by enclosing the string in single quotes (```'```). A single quote within the string can be encoded by putting two single quotes in a row. C-style escapes using the backslash character are not supported because they are not standard SQL. BLOB literals are string literals containing hexadecimal data and preceded by a single "x" or "X" character, for example ```X'53514C697465'```

A literal value can also be the token ```NULL```.

The ```LIKE``` operator does a pattern matching comparison. The operand to the right contains the pattern, the left hand operand contains the string to match against the pattern. A percent symbol ```%``` in the pattern matches any sequence of zero or more characters in the string. An underscore ```_``` in the pattern matches any single character in the string. Any other character matches itself or its equivalent (i.e. case-sensitive matching). The ```LIKE``` operator is case sensitive in Comdb2.

The ```GLOB``` operator is similar to ```LIKE``` but uses the Unix file globbing syntax for its wildcards. ```GLOB``` is case sensitive. Both ```GLOB``` and ```LIKE``` may be preceded by the ```NOT``` keyword to invert the sense of the test.

A column name can be any of the names of the columns defined in the table.

```SELECT``` statements can appear in expressions as either the right-hand operand of the ```IN``` operator, as a scalar quantity, or as the operand of an ```EXISTS``` operator. As a scalar quantity or the operand of an ```IN``` operator, the ```SELECT``` should have only a single column in its result. Compound ```SELECT``` expressions (connected with keywords like ```UNION``` or ```EXCEPT```) are allowed. With the ```EXISTS``` operator, the columns in the result set of the ```SELECT``` are ignored and the expression returns TRUE if one or more rows exist and FALSE if the result set is empty. If no terms in the ```SELECT``` expression refer to value in the containing query, then the expression is evaluated once prior to any other processing and the result is reused as necessary. If the ```SELECT``` expression does contain variables from the outer query, then the ```SELECT``` is reevaluated every time it is needed.

When a ```SELECT``` is the right operand of the ```IN``` operator, the ```IN``` operator returns TRUE if the result of the left operand is any of the values generated by the select. The ```IN``` operator may be preceded by the ```NOT``` keyword to invert the sense of the test.

When a ```SELECT``` appears within an expression but is not the right operand of an ```IN``` operator, then the first row of the result of the ```SELECT``` becomes the value used in the expression. If the ```SELECT``` yields more than one result row, all rows after the first are ignored. If the ```SELECT``` yields no rows, then the value of the ```SELECT``` is ```NULL```.

A ```CAST``` expression changes the datatype of the <expr> into the type specified by <type> inside the database engine. It has no guarantee of influencing types that cross the boundary to the client. If you want to change the type of the data being returned, you're better off setting the output type in the database call instead of using ```CAST```. Supported values for <type> are:

  * ```TEXT``` - convert to a string.
  * ```REAL``` - convert to a real.
  * ```INTEGER``` - convert to an integer.
  * ```NUMERIC``` - convert to a real first, then convert to an integer if doing that is lossless and reversible.
  * ```DATETIME``` - convert to a datetime.
  * ```BLOB``` - convert to a blob.

Unknown types default to ```NUMERIC```.

Both simple and aggregate functions are supported. A simple function can be used in any expression. Simple functions return a result immediately based on their inputs. Aggregate functions may only be used in a ```SELECT``` statement. Aggregate functions compute their result across all rows of the result set.

## Built-in SQL functions

Note that much of this documentation comes from SQLite.

Function | Description
---------|------------
ltrim (X [, Y]) | The ltrim(X,Y) function returns a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from the left side of X. If the Y argument is omitted, ltrim(X) removes spaces from the left side of X.
rtrim (X [, Y]) | The rtrim(X,Y) function returns a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from the right side of X. If the Y argument is omitted, rtrim(X) removes spaces from the right side of X.
trim (X [, Y]) | The trim(X,Y) function returns a string formed by removing any and all characters that appear in Y from both ends of X. If the Y argument is omitted, trim(X) removes spaces from both ends of X.
min (X [, Y, ...) | The multi-argument min() function returns the argument with the minimum value. The multi-argument min() function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If none of the arguments to min() define a collating function, then the BINARY collating function is used. Note that min() is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but operates as an aggregate function if given only a single argument.
max (X [, Y, ...) | The multi-argument max() function returns the argument with the maximum value, or return NULL if any argument is NULL. The multi-argument max() function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If none of the arguments to max() define a collating function, then the BINARY collating function is used. Note that max() is a simple function when it has 2 or more arguments but operates as an aggregate function if given only a single argument.
typeof (X) | The typeof(X) function returns a string that indicates the datatype of the expression X: "null", "integer", "real", "text", "datetime", "interval_ym", "interval_ds", "decimal", or "blob".
length (X) | For a string value X, the length(X) function returns the number of characters (not bytes) in X prior to the first NUL character. Since SQLite strings do not normally contain NUL characters, the length(X) function will usually return the total number of characters in the string X. For a blob value X, length(X) returns the number of bytes in the blob. If X is NULL then length(X) is NULL. If X is numeric then length(X) returns the length of a string representation of X.
instr (X, Y) | The instr(X,Y) function finds the first occurrence of string Y within string X and returns the number of prior characters plus 1, or 0 if Y is nowhere found within X. Or, if X and Y are both BLOBs, then instr(X,Y) returns one more than the number bytes prior to the first occurrence of Y, or 0 if Y does not occur anywhere within X. If both arguments X and Y to instr(X,Y) are non-NULL and are not BLOBs then both are interpreted as strings. If either X or Y are NULL in instr(X,Y) then the result is NULL.
sleep (X) | Causes the query to sleep for X seconds.  Returns X.
printf (FORMAT, ...) | printf(FORMAT,...) The printf(FORMAT,...) SQL function works like the sqlite3_mprintf() C-language function and the printf() function from the standard C library. The first argument is a format string that specifies how to construct the output string using values taken from subsequent arguments. If the FORMAT argument is missing or NULL then the result is NULL. The %n format is silently ignored and does not consume an argument. The %p format is an alias for %X. The %z format is interchangeable with %s. If there are too few arguments in the argument list, missing arguments are assumed to have a NULL value, which is translated into 0 or 0.0 for numeric formats or an empty string for %s.
unicode (X) | The unicode(X) function returns the numeric unicode code point corresponding to the first character of the string X. If the argument to unicode(X) is not a string then the result is undefined.
char (X1,X2,...,XN) | The char(X1,X2,...,XN) function returns a string composed of characters having the unicode code point values of integers X1 through XN, respectively.
abs (X) | The abs(X) function returns the absolute value of the numeric argument X. Abs(X) returns NULL if X is NULL. Abs(X) returns 0.0 if X is a string or blob that cannot be converted to a numeric value. If X is the integer -9223372036854775808 then abs(X) throws an integer overflow error since there is no equivalent positive 64-bit two complement value.
round (X [, Y]) | The round(X,Y) function returns a floating-point value X rounded to Y digits to the right of the decimal point. If the Y argument is omitted, it is assumed to be 0.
upper (X) | The upper(X) function returns a copy of input string X in which all lower-case ASCII characters are converted to their upper-case equivalent.
lower (X) | The lower(X) function returns a copy of string X with all ASCII characters converted to lower case. The default built-in lower() function works for ASCII characters only. To do case conversions on non-ASCII characters, load the ICU extension.
hex (X) | The hex() function interprets its argument as a BLOB and returns a string which is the upper-case hexadecimal rendering of the content of that blob.
ifnull (X, Y) | The ifnull() function returns a copy of its first non-NULL argument, or NULL if both arguments are NULL. Ifnull() must have exactly 2 arguments. The ifnull() function is equivalent to coalesce() with two arguments.
random | The random() function returns a pseudo-random integer between -9223372036854775808 and +9223372036854775807.
randomblob (N) | The randomblob(N) function return an N-byte blob containing pseudo-random bytes. If N is less than 1 then a 1-byte random blob is returned.  Hint: applications can generate globally unique identifiers using this function together with hex() and/or lower() like this: hex(randomblob(16)),  lower(hex(randomblob(16)))
guid | Returns a 16-byte blob unique identifier.
guid_str | Returns a UUID formatted a string in the standard XXXXXXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-AAAA-BBBBBBBBBBBB notation
guid | Returns a 16-byte blob unique identifier.
guid (X) | X should be a string representing a UUID.  Returns an equivalent UUID as a blob.
guid_str (X) | Converts a blob X into a string UUID representation.
nullif (X, Y) | The nullif(X,Y) function returns its first argument if the arguments are different and NULL if the arguments are the same. The nullif(X,Y) function searches its arguments from left to right for an argument that defines a collating function and uses that collating function for all string comparisons. If neither argument to nullif() defines a collating function then the BINARY is used.
quote (X) | The quote(X) function returns the text of an SQL literal which is the value of its argument suitable for inclusion into an SQL statement. Strings are surrounded by single-quotes with escapes on interior quotes as needed. BLOBs are encoded as hexadecimal literals. Strings with embedded NUL characters cannot be represented as string literals in SQL and hence the returned string literal is truncated prior to the first NUL.
replace (X, Y, Z) | The replace(X,Y,Z) function returns a string formed by substituting string Z for every occurrence of string Y in string X. The BINARY collating sequence is used for comparisons. If Y is an empty string then return X unchanged. If Z is not initially a string, it is cast to a UTF-8 string prior to processing.
zeroblob (N) | The zeroblob(N) function returns a BLOB consisting of N bytes of 0x00.
substr (X, Y [, Z]) | The substr(X,Y,Z) function returns a substring of input string X that begins with the Y-th character and which is Z characters long. If Z is omitted then substr(X,Y) returns all characters through the end of the string X beginning with the Y-th. The left-most character of X is number 1. If Y is negative then the first character of the substring is found by counting from the right rather than the left. If Z is negative then the abs(Z) characters preceding the Y-th character are returned. If X is a string then characters indices refer to actual UTF-8 characters. If X is a BLOB then the indices refer to bytes.
sum(X), total(X) | The sum() and total() aggregate functions return sum of all non-NULL values in the group. If there are no non-NULL input rows then sum() returns NULL but total() returns 0.0. NULL is not normally a helpful result for the sum of no rows but the SQL standard requires it and most other SQL database engines implement sum() that way so SQLite does it in the same way in order to be compatible. The non-standard total() function is provided as a convenient way to work around this design problem in the SQL language.  The result of total() is always a floating point value. The result of sum() is an integer value if all non-NULL inputs are integers. If any input to sum() is neither an integer or a NULL then sum() returns a floating point value which might be an approximation to the true sum.  Sum() will throw an "integer overflow" exception if all inputs are integers or NULL and an integer overflow occurs at any point during the computation. Total() never throws an integer overflow.
avg(X) | The avg() function returns the average value of all non-NULL X within a group. String and BLOB values that do not look like numbers are interpreted as 0. The result of avg() is always a floating point value as long as at there is at least one non-NULL input even if all inputs are integers. The result of avg() is NULL if and only if there are no non-NULL inputs.
count(X), count(*) | The count(X) function returns a count of the number of times that X is not NULL in a group. The count(*) function (with no arguments) returns the total number of rows in the group.
group_concat(X [, Y]) | The group_concat() function returns a string which is the concatenation of all non-NULL values of X. If parameter Y is present then it is used as the separator between instances of X. A comma (",") is used as the separator if Y is omitted. The order of the concatenated elements is arbitrary.
glob(X, Y) | The glob(X,Y) function is equivalent to the expression "Y GLOB X". Note that the X and Y arguments are reversed in the glob() function relative to the infix GLOB operator. If the sqlite3_create_function() interface is used to override the glob(X,Y) function with an alternative implementation then the GLOB operator will invoke the alternative implementation.
like(X, Y [, Z]) | The like() function is used to implement the "Y LIKE X [ESCAPE Z]" expression. If the optional ESCAPE clause is present, then the like() function is invoked with three arguments. Otherwise, it is invoked with two arguments only. Note that the X and Y parameters are reversed in the like() function relative to the infix LIKE operator. The sqlite3_create_function() interface can be used to override the like() function and thereby change the operation of the LIKE operator. When overriding the like() function, it may be important to override both the two and three argument versions of the like() function. Otherwise, different code may be called to implement the LIKE operator depending on whether or not an ESCAPE clause was specified.
