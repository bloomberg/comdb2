## Overview

Comdb2 provides two ways to define or modify a table schema. A declarative
language (discussed here) and the standard data definition language, like
other relational database systems. The support for latter was added in version
7.0, discussed in [SQL language](sql.html) in more details.

In the first approach, Comdb2 supports a language that is declarative rather
than imperative. The entire schema per table is presented to the database at
once.  It's up to the database to figure out which indices to add/remove/modify,
which fields to grow, shrink, etc.  A table definition has a several sections:

* [Constants](#constants-section)

* [Table definition](#schema-section)

* [Keys](#key-section)

* [Constraints](#constraints-section)

Comments begin with ```//``` and go until the end of the line. Multi-line
comments enclosed in ```/* ... */``` are also supported.

## Constants section

![constants](images/constant-section.gif)

Users can specify constant values in this section to use in the rest of the definition.  This is occasionally helpful when several fields should
be sized the same.  This practice is of limited utility.  The constants section consists of the keyword `constants` and a list of
constants enclosed by braces.  Example:

```
constants {
    ZERO=0,
    ONE=1,
    TWO=2,
    THREE=3,
    SEVEN=7,
    HELLO=-44,
    TWELVE=12
}
```

The constraint section is optional.

## Schema section

![schema](images/schema-section.gif)

The table definition lists the fields present in the table, along with their default values whether NULL values
are allowed.  NULLs are not allowed by default.  The section is indicated with the ```schema``` keyword, and the list
of fields enclosed by braces.

Field types are explained in the [data types](datatypes.html) section.  A field is defined by listing its type, 
name, size (if allowed/required by type), followed by optional field keywords.

A example table definition looks like this:

```
schema {
    cstring      first_name[32]                    // first name
    cstring      last_name[32]
    int          userid
    double       balance     dbstore=100.00 null=yes
    datetime     paydate     dbstore="CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
    byte         permissions[12]
}

```

The field keywords are:

* ```null=<yes|no>```
  ```null=no``` is the implied value.  ```null=no``` means this column will not accept values of NULL.  
  ```null=yes``` means this column will accept values of NULL.
* ```dbstore=<numeric, string or hex literal>``` this is the value that will be stored for this column if 
  no value for the column was provided by the client. (for example, if a client added a record through a user defined tag which omitted a column).
* ```dbpad=<integer literal>```
    Only valid for byte arrays.  If a smaller byte array needs to be converted to a larger byte array it will be padded with this value.  If a larger byte array needs to be truncated then it can be truncated **provided** that the lost bytes match this value.  Value given should be an integer in the range 0..255.

The dbstore value must have the same datatype as the column they are attached to, with these exceptions:

* Blob fields cannot have dbstore values.
* For datetime fields you can specify a string such as "2017-03-08T235959.987 America/New_York" or "CURRENT_TIMESTAMP"
for current database system timestamp.
* For byte arrays you can specify dbstore=0 to indicate that it should be zeroed be default.

The schema section is required - it's the only required section.

## Key section

![keys](images/key-section.gif)

Comdb2 does not require a table to have keys, and there is no requirement of a "primary key." The key section 
is optional.

Consider the previously defined record: Let's say we'd like to create 3 keys.  First one will be unique 
and have one field ```userid```.  Second will store user's *last_name* and *first_name*.  Third will 
store `paydate`.  Compound keys can be formed by simply adding fields together with a '+'.  Here's what the 
key section would look like.

```
keys
{
       "KEY_SERIAL" = userid
       "KEY_NAME" = last_name + first_name
       "KEY_DATE" = paydate
}
```

The above specification states that there are 3 **unique** keys defined for the table.

### Partial Indexes
A partial index is an index over a subset of the rows of a table. Any index that
includes the `{WHERE <expr>}` clause at the end is considered to be a partial
index. Only rows of the table for which the WHERE clause evaluates to true are
included in the index. If the WHERE clause expression evaluates to NULL or to
false for some rows of the table, then those rows are omitted from the index.

The WHERE clause must be placed within a pair of curly braces. The
[expr](sql.html#expr) could be any expressions used in SQL with some
restrictions. The `<expr>` may not contain sub-queries, references to other
tables, non-deterministic functions, or bound parameters. For more information
on allowed expressions, please read
[SQLite's Partial Indexes Documentation](https://sqlite.org/partialindex.html).

The first motivation of having partial indexes in a table is to avoid indexing
uninterested data, which can reduce the size of indexes and speed up index
searches.

Considering the following example:

Let's say we have a online shopping platform and we want to store orders info
into database. An order record could contains `id`, `email`, `total`, etc. We
might be interested in those orders that have `total` greater than $1,000 and
want to send some coupons to their emails as holiday gifts.

To filter out those orders that we are less interested in, we can have the
following schema:

```
[create table orders {
    schema {
        int     id
        cstring email[20]
        int     total
    }
    keys {
        "id"    = id
        "email" = email {where total > 1000}
    }
}] rc 0
```

The index "email" only contains records that have `total` greater than $1,000.
When we want to quickly retrieve their emails, we don't need to scan the whole
table but only those satisfy the condition.

```
(selectid=0, order=0, from=0, detail='SCAN TABLE orders USING INDEX $EMAIL_6BDD7427 (491520 rows)')
[explain query plan select email from orders where total > 1000] rc 0
```

Another motivation of having partial indexes is to enforce uniqueness across
some subset of rows in a table.

Here is an example from
[SQLite's documentation](https://sqlite.org/partialindex.html):

Suppose you have a database of the members of a large organization where each
person is assigned to a particular "team". Each team has a "leader" who is also
a member of that team.

The `team_id` field cannot be unique because there usually
multiple people on the same team. One cannot make the combination of `team_id`
and `is_leader` unique since there are usually multiple non-leaders on each
team.

The solution to enforcing one leader per team is to create a unique index on
`team_id` but restricted to those entries for which `is_leader` is true:

```
create table person {
    schema {
        int person_id
        int team_id
        int is_leader
    }
    keys {
        "p_id" = person_id
        "t_id" = team_id {where is_leader}
    }
}
```

The "t_id" index is useful when we want to quickly locate the person who is the
leader of a specific team:

```
(selectid=0, order=0, from=0, detail='SEARCH TABLE person USING INDEX $T_ID_4CFA0F9B (team_id=?) (~1 row)')
[explain query plan select person_id from person where is_leader and team_id = 10] rc 0
```

### Indexes on Expressions
As shown in the key definition syntax diagram above, `(idxexpr-type)"<expr>"`
defines a key piece on an expression --- [expr](sql.html#expr) enclosed in
double quotes with a type surrounded by round brackets.
`idxexpr-type`s supported are as follows:
![idxexpr-type](images/idxexpr-type.gif).

See
[SQLite's Indexes on Expressions Documentation](http://sqlite.org/expridx.html)
for restrictions on expressions that appear in indexes.

For example, if we want to store JSON strings to database, with indexes on
expressions, we can create indexes on JSON columns using JSON functions
(expressions).

```
[create table jdemo {
    schema {
        vutf8 json[128]
    }
    keys {
        "a" = (int)"json_extract(json, '$.a')"
        "b" = (cstring[10])"json_extract(json, '$.b')"
    }
}] rc 0
(rows inserted=2)
[insert into jdemo values ('{"a":0,"b":"zero"}'), ('{"a":1,"b":"one"}')] rc 0
(rows inserted=2)
[insert into jdemo values ('{"a":2,"b":"two"}'), ('{"a":3,"b":"three"}')] rc 0
(json='{"a":3,"b":"three"}')
(json='{"a":0,"b":"zero"}')
(json='{"a":1,"b":"one"}')
(json='{"a":2,"b":"two"}')
[select * from jdemo] rc 0
```

Now, if we want all value of JSON column "a" in ascending order, index "a" can
be used:

```
(selectid=0, order=0, from=0, detail='SCAN TABLE jdemo USING INDEX $A_520C7C1B (4 rows)')
[explain query plan select json_extract(json, '$.a') as a from jdemo order by json_extract(json, '$.a')] rc 0
```

Similarly, here is a typical query that uses index "b":

```
(selectid=0, order=0, from=0, detail='SCAN TABLE jdemo USING INDEX $B_504AC242 (4 rows)')
[explain query plan select json_extract(json, '$.b') as b from jdemo order by json_extract(json, '$.b')] rc 0
```



### Duplicate Keys.
For the second and third keys in the example above, there's a great possibility of having duplicate key 
entries. (>1 users can share the same paydate, and multiple users can have the same first and last names).

Preceding a key name with ```dup``` marks that key as allowing duplicate entries.

```
keys
{
       "KEY_SERIAL" = userid
  dup  "KEY_NAME" = last_name + first_name
  dup  "KEY_DATE" = paydate
}
```


### Datacopy Keys.
If the key definition is preceded by the ```datacopy``` keyword, then the backing index will maintain a copy of 
the data record in the btree used for the index.  This copy is maintained transparently by the database.  
This allows for large performance gains when reading sequential records from on a key.  The trade-off is the 
use of more disk space.

### Ascending and Descending Keys.

It is possible to make any piece of a key be sorted in DESCENDING order by using the ```<DESCEND>``` keyword (must 
be uppercase).  For example,

```"KEY_NAME" = <DESCEND>last_name + first_name``` 

In this example, last_name is stored in descending order, while first_name is stored in **ascending** order.  You 
can specify ascending key pieces with the ```<ASCEND>``` keyword, but it is not necessary since this is the default.

## Constraints Section

![constraints](images/constraint-section.gif)

The constraints section is an optional section of the table definition used to specify foreign key constraints.
It establishes a relationship between keys in the current table and keys in other (foreign) tables.

The syntax is ```"LOCAL_KEYNAME" -> "REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME":"REFERENCED_KEY_NAME"```

```LOCAL_KEYNAME``` is the name of the key in the current table  ```REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME``` is the name of the 
table which contains the key which is being pointed at.  ```REFERENCED_KEY_NAME``` is the name of the key in 
the foreign table.  The datatypes of the columns comprising these keys need not match, though the contents must 
be convertible.  The local key can be a prefix of the foreign key, and the foreign key can be a prefix of the 
local key.

A key can point at more than one key by specifying multiple ```"REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME":"REFERENCED_KEY_NAME"``` 
items on the same line delimited by white-space.  A key can point to a key within its own table by specifying 
its own table name in ```REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME```.

Cascading deletes are supported on a constraint by adding the text ```on delete cascade``` (all in lower case) to 
the end of the constraint line.  Cascading updates are supported on a constraint by adding the text 
```on update cascade``` (all in lower case) to the end of the constraint line.

For some more detailed notes on the behavior of foreign key constraints, please see the 
[constraints](constraints.html) section.

### Using Partial Indexes in Constraints
Foreign key constraints ensure that a given key value in a table exists in a 
corresponding key in another table.

If a partial index is used as a local key in a constraint, the constraint is
only checked for rows included in the index.

If a partial index is used as a referenced key in a constraint, then the
referenced key might only include a subset of rows in the referenced table.
If a given local key value does not exist in the referenced key (which is a
partial index), it is considered a constraint violation even if there might
exist some excluded rows that would form a matching key if they were included
in the referenced index.

### Using Indexes on Expressions in Constraints
Indexes on expressions are allowed in key constraints. However, if the local key
of a constraint is an index on expressions, then cascading update is NOT
supported on the constraint.


## User Schemas
Comdb2 supports tables in user's namespace. This allows multiple users to have tables with same name.

To enable it, this lrl option needs to be enabled
```
allow_user_schema
```

The following example will create multiple users and separate table (with same name) for each user.
Querying comdb2_tables from op user account will show all the tables.


```sql
put password 'user' for 'user'
put password 'user1' for 'user1'
put password 'user2' for 'user2'
grant op to user

set user user
set password user
put authentication on /* Only op can turn on the authentication. */

select * from comdb2_users
(username='user', isOP='Y')
(username='user1', isOP='N')
(username='user2', isOP='N')
[select * from comdb2_users] rc 0


set user user1
set password user1
create table test { tag ondisk {int t} keys { "T1" = t}}$$
insert into test values(1)
(rows inserted=1)

set user user2
set password user2
create table test { tag ondisk {int t} keys { "T1" = t}}$$
insert into test values(2)
(rows inserted=1)

set user user1
set password user1
select * from test
(t=1)

set user user2
set password user2
select * from test
(t=2)

set user user
set password user
select * from comdb2_tables
(tablename='sqlite_stat1')
(tablename='sqlite_stat2')
(tablename='sqlite_stat4')
(tablename='test@user1')
(tablename='test@user2')
```
