## LRL files

Comdb2 configuration files have an .lrl extension for historic reasons.  No configuration file is required.  If no file is 
specified, the database will pick reasonable defaults.  On startup, the database will look for the following files, and 
read them, in order:
1. `$COMDB2_ROOT/etc/cdb2/config/comdb2.lrl`
1. `$COMDB2_ROOT/etc/cdb2/config/comdb2_local.lrl`
1. `$COMDB2_ROOT/etc/cdb2/config.d/*.lrl` 
1. `dbname.lrl` (for your database's name)

`COMDB2_ROOT` is set at compile time (defaults to `/opt/bb/`).  Setting a `$COMDB2_ROOT` environment variable overrides
the default value.

The intent behind multiple config files is to make deployment of settings easier. `comdb2.lrl` is meant to contain settings
that are identical across many databases in your application.  `comdb2_local.lrl` is for settings that are local to this
machine.  Files under `config.d` are useful for organizing settings in multiple files (the 'include' directive in .lrl files
can also accomplish this).

The last file read is the database specific lrl file.  This contains settings specific to a given database.  Comdb2 will look
for this file in one of these locations, in this order:

1. Current directory
1. In database directory if it's specified with `--dir /path/to/db` on command line
1. In the default database location, if the database directory isn't specified
1. In the location specified with '--lrl /path/to/dbname.lrl` on command line

Lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments and skipped.  Other lines should consist of a directive and its value.

## Database tunables.

### Cache size

Cache size can be set with the the 'cache' tunable. It takes a cache size and a unit (kb, mb, gb).  For example

    cache 64 mb

This gets you 64 megabytes of cache.  The database will print its cache size when starting up:

    Cache:64MB  Segments:1  Segment-size:64MB

The default cache size is 64MB.  You can set policies on a machine by capping the min and max settings for cachesize (putting
these in global comdb2.lrl or comdb2_local.lrl is a good idea.  For example to set the minimum cache size at 8MB, and restrict
the maximum at 1GB (say, for a shared machine), one can have:

    cachekbmin 8192
    cachekbmax 1048576

Maximum and minimum values are given in KB.

### Thread Pools

There are various threadpools in Comdb2 responsible for specific work.  They all take a common set of options.  

|Name                   |Function                              |Default size    |Default max queue depth|
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
|appsockpool            |Pool for application connections      |Unlimited       |0                      |
|sqlenginepool          |Pool for sql runner threads           |48              |500                    |
|iopool                 |Cache flusher threads                 |4               |8000                   |

The following options are available for configuring thread pool parameters:

|Parameters             |Function
|-----------------------|---------
|mint                   |Minimum number of threads to keep around.  Threads above this value will exit after `linger` seconds.  Raise this if the thread pool reports lots of thread creates.
|maxt                   |Maximum number of threads to keep around.  Lower this you don't get gains from additional concurrency for the specific subsystem.
|linger                 |How long threads above `mint` will hang around (in seconds) before exiting.
|maxagems               |Max age of an item on a queue in ms.  Items older than given will be dropped.
|exit_on_error          |If set (argument is `on`), database will exit if it can't spin up new threads for this threadpool.
|dump_on_full           |If set, argument is `on`) will dump the current state of the threadpool when the queue is full
|maxq                   |Maximum queue depth.  If `maxt` threads are active and none are available, items are enqueued.  If the queue reaches this depth, requests to enqueue further are dropped.
|maxqover               |Maximum queue override depth.  Queued items below this limit won't generate warnings.

Examples:

To limit the number of concurrent SQL threads for this node to 12:

`sqlenginepool maxt 12`

To dump the SQL thread pool every time the queue is full:

`sqlenginepool maxq dump_on_error on`

### Networks

There are a few references to various "networks" in the descriptions below.  All machines specified by the 
`cluster nodes` tunable (or added dynamically) form connections.  There is 2 dedicated threads for each machine
for reading and writing messages.  There's 3 "networks" formed for each database (so 3 sets of connections).
Each network has its own set of tunables.  Messages are queued for each destination, and are flushed when
necessary.  All nodes periodically send heartbeats.  Lack of a heartbeat is treated like a network drop.
Network tunables for controlling heartbeat parameters, queue sizes, etc. are listed below.  The following 
sections describe each network's uses.

|Option              |Default              |Description
|--------------------|---------------------|------------
|netbufsz | 1048576 (1 MB) | Size of the network buffer (per node) for the replication network
|netbufsz_signal | 65536 | Size of the network buffer (per node) for the signal network
|heartbeat_check_time | 10 (seconds) | Consider an error if no heartbeat for this many seconds
|net_max_queue                    |25000       | Maximum number of items to keep on replication network queue before dropping (per replicant)
|nax_max_mem                      |0 (not set) | Maximum size (in MB) of items keep on replication network queue before dropping (per replicant)
|net_throttle_percent             |50          | Throttles write requests from replicants if the replication network queue is `net_throttle_percent` full
|net_max_queue_signal             |100         | Maximum number of items to keep on the signal network queue before dropping (per replicant)
|net_poll                         |100 ms      | Allow a connection to linger for this many ms before identifying itself. Connections that take longer are shut down.
|osql_net_poll                    |100 ms      | Like `net_sql`, but for the offload network (used by write transactions on replicants to send work to the master)
|net_portmux_register_interval    |600 ms      | Check on this interval if our port is correctly registered with pmux for the replication net
|signal_net_portmux_register_interval | 600 ms | Like `osql_net_poll` for the signal network
|osql_net_portmux_register_interval | 600 ms   | like `net_portmux_register_interval`
|osql_max_queue | 25000 | Like `net_max_queue` for offload net
|osql_bkoff_netsend | 100 ms | On a full offload net queue, attempt to wait this long before attempting to resend
|osql_bkoff_netsend_lmt | 300000 | Wait a total of this many ms attempting to send on the offload net
|toblock_net_throttle | not set | If set, will throttle writes on a full network queue
|no_toblock_net_throttle | | Disables no_toblock_net_throttle
|enque_flush_interval | 1000 | Try to flush network queue after this many writes for the replication net
|enque_flush_interval_signal | 1000 | Try to flush network queue after this many writes for the signal net
|enque_reorder_lookahead | 20 | When messages are sent out of order, peek at this many messages on the queue in attempt to reorder
|osql_heartbeat_send_time | 5 (sec) | Like heartbeat_send_time for the offload network
|osql_heartbeat_alert_time | 10 (sec) | Like heartbeat_check_time for the offload network
|net_explicit_flush_trace | not set | Produce a stack dump for long network flushes 
|no_net_explicit_flush_trace | | Turns off stack dumps for long network flushes
|udp | set | Transaction acks are sent back to master via UDP.  Since UDP is potentially lossy, replicants will inject the current LSN ack into their TCP channel to the master every 500 ms.  On a lossy network, if you see lots of 500ms transactions, you may want to disable UDP.  Such cases aren't typical.
|noudp | | Disables `udp`.

#### Replication

The replication network handles replication-specific traffic between database nodes.  This includes
election messages, log messages (ie: normal replication), requests for re-transmits, etc.  Steps 3 and 4
in [Transaction Life cycle](transaction_model.html#life-cycle-of-a-transaction) go over the replication network.

#### Offload

The offload net is used by replicants to send work to the master to apply.  Replicants run SQL and assemble
a set of record modifications to be applied.  Steps 2 and 5 in [Transaction Life cycle](transaction_model.html#life-cycle-of-a-transaction) 
go over the offload net.

#### Signal

The signal net is reserved for future use.

### Sync commands

These tunables control how often the database flushes its log to disk, and what nodes are required to acknowledge
a log entry before control is returned to the user.  All these tunables start with the 'sync' command, and the
following word determine which option is being set.  The default mode is to NOT flush logs on every transaction,
and to wait for all nodes to acknowledge a transaction before returning success.


|Option              |Default              |Description
|--------------------|---------------------|------------
|full                |not set              |Logs are flushed on every commit
|normal              |set                  |Logs are NOT flushed on every commit (ie: you can lose transactions if all the nodes in the cluster crash).  This is the default.  This option also implies fully synchronous replication - ie: wait for all nodes to ack before returning success.
|rep_always_wait     |not set              |Wait for all nodes, including those that aren't connected (not recommended)
|none                |not set              |Asynchronous replication, don't wait for any replication acknowledgments before returning success.
|room                |not set              |Wait for acknowledgments only from nodes in the same availability zone/data center (see [room affinity](clients.html#room)). 
|log-sync-time       |10 (seconds)         |Sets how often we flush the logs to disk.
|log-delete-now      |set                  |Make all log files eligible for deletion when not needed
|log-delete-before   |not set              |Make all log files older than current time are eligible for deletion when not needed
|log-delete-age-set  |                     |Takes epoch time in seconds, log files older than the given time are eligible for deletion when not needed
|log-delete          |on                   |`on` enables log deletion, `off` disables it


### Allow/Disallow commands

These commands control machine class permissions.  For every incoming connection, Comdb2 will try to read its class
from comdb2db once.  `allow` and `disallow` can be used to set up policies for which classes of machines are allowed
to access databases.  For example, you may have a blanket rule that production databases can only be accessed by
production machines, etc.  Commands have this syntax:

    allow|disallow writes|cluster|broadcast [from] class|machine

Class should be one of 'dev', 'alpha', 'beta', 'prod'.  Any other value is assumed to be a machine name.

`writes` allows/disallows transactions that change the state of the database from the given source. `cluster`
allows/disallows forming clusters with machines from the given source. `broadcast` allows/disallows consumer 
connections from the given source.

### Switches

Switches are simple on/off settings that generally control debugging or experimental features.  They can
be enabled with the `on` option, and disabled with `off`.  Unless debugging/developing Comdb2, toggling these
is generally not advised.

#### `sqllogger` commands

There's a detailed SQL logging system in place.  It allows fine-grained data collection on queries.  This
can be controlled with the `sqllogger` commands.  Logs themselves are binary files that are dumped into
the database directory with the name $DBNAME.sqllog.  When rolled, they before $DBNAME.sqllog.1,
$DBNAME.sqllog.2, etc.

|sql logger command| description

### Incoherent nodes overview

One problem with synchronous replication is that commit time is dominated by the slowest node.  What's worse,
a node that stops responding altogether can hold up replication forever.  To avoid these problems, the master
may choose to mark nodes ***incoherent***.  Incoherent nodes continue to operate as before with 2 exceptions:

   * They will no longer service any requests - any new queries/transactions that come in are rejected and
     will go to another node.
   * The master will no longer wait for replication acknowledgments from incoherent nodes.

There's 2 ways for a node to be marked incoherent.  The first catches outright broken nodes.  If any nodes
have acknowledged a transaction, and any other node takes longer than a configured threshold to respond, it's
considered broken and marked incoherent.  The second option captures nodes that are statistically slower than
other nodes.  A node where the running average of acknowledgment times over the last minute twice as bad as 
the second bad node (withing some minimum threshold) is considered slow, and will become incoherent.

Incoherent nodes are self-healing.  If a node marked incoherent catches up to the master, the master will
mark it coherent again, will resume waiting for replication, and the node will be free to service requests.  If
a node was marked slow (second method, listed above), it will become coherent once its running average is back
within the configured threshold.

The tunables in this section control the various tunables used to decide when nodes are to be considered 
incoherent

DB layer tunables:

|Option              | Default        | Description
|--------------------|----------------|-------------
|incoherent_msg_freq | 3600 (seconds) | Drop a warning file if a node is incoherent (see [incoherent nodes overview](#incoherent-nodes-overview)) for more information.
|incoherent_alarm_time | 120 (seconds) | Warn about incoherent nodes this often.
|max_incoherent_nodes | 1 | Number of incoherent nodes before an alarm triggers.
|net_lmt_upd_incoherent_nodes | 70 (%)| When this percent of a network queue is full, throttle messages to incoherent nodes.

BDB layer tunables (see [bdbattr tunables](#bdbattr-tunables))

|Option              | Default        | Description
|--------------------|----------------|---------------
|REPTIMEOUT_LAG | 50 (PERCENT) | Used in replication.  Once a node has received our update, we will wait REPTIMEOUT_LAG% of the time that took for all other nodes.  
|REPTIMEOUT_MINMS | 10000 (MSECS) | Even if the first node comes back quickly, wait at least this many ms to replicate to other nodes.
|REPTIMEOUT_MAXMS | 5 * 60 * 1000 (MSECS) | We should wait this long for one node to acknowledge replication.  If after this time we have failed to replicate anywhere then the entire cluster is incoherent!
|REP_DEBUG_DELAY | 0 (MSECS) | For debugging - set an artificial replication delay
|TOOMANYSKIPPED | 2 (QUANTITY) | Call for election again and delay commits if more than this many nodes are incoherent
|SKIPDELAYBASE | 100 (MSECS) | Delay commits by at least this much if forced to delay by incoherent nodes
|REPMETHODMAXSLEEP | 300 (SECS) | Delay commits by at most this much if forced to delay by incoherent nodes

### `sql_tranlevel_default` options

These options allow you to set the default SQL transaction level across the database.  Any setting here can
be overwritten by running 'SET TRANSACTION ...' after connecting to the database.  See [Isolation Levels](transaction_model.html#isolation-levels-and-artifacts) for available transaction levels. 

|sql_tranlevel option | description
|---------------------|-------------
|sql_tranlevel_default default|Set to `default` isolation level
|sql_tranlevel_default recom|Set to `READ COMMITTED` isolation level
|sql_tranlevel_default snapshot|Set to `SNAPSHOT` isolation level
|sql_tranlevel_default serial|Set to `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level

### Query limit commands

Queries running in the database can be limited in cost.  The database can optionally warn when a query reaches
a certain cost, or prevent it from running further.

|querylimit option | description
|---------------------|-------------
|querylimit maxcost N|Set the maximum cost the database will allow for a query to N|
|querylimit warn maxcost N|Warn if a query has a cost > N | 
|querylimit maxcost off|Turn off returning errors for queries over a cost limit
|querylimit warn maxcost off|Turn off warnings for queries over a cost limit

### Decimal rounding options

The rounding policy for rounding for columns of decimal types can be controlled with the `decimal_rounding` option. 
Available options are:

|decimal_rounding option | description
|------------------------|-------------
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_NONE|Don't round
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_CEILING|Round towards +infinity 
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_UP|Round away from 0               
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_HALF_UP|0.5 rounds up                   
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_HALF_EVEN|0.5 rounds to nearest even (default)
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_HALF_DOWN|0.5 rounds down                 
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_DOWN|Round towards 0 (truncate)      
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_FLOOR|Round towards -infinity         
decimal_rounding DEC_ROUND_05UP|Round for reround

### `bdbattr` tunables

These tunables control the 'BDB' layer of the db.  Its main responsibility is setting tunables that control
lower-level functions like replication, various timeouts, etc.  These are set with the 'setattr' tunable.  The

#### Replay detection tunables

Comdb2 databases allow the client APIs to replay a transaction if its outcome is uncertain (ie: client issues commit,
but the database drops a connection, so uncertain whether it committed).  This system is internally called "blkseq" (block
sequence).  Tunables to control it are below

#### Coherency options

Comdb2 will mark nodes that are non-responsive "incoherent".  Incoherent nodes will not respond to new queries and
replication will not wait for them acknowledge events.  Nodes stay incoherent until the are caught up to the rest of
the cluster.  The master node will send replicants a coherency lease to allow them to stay coherent.  It'll withhold the
lease if a node is either not responding or is significantly slower than the other nodes.

|tablescan_cache_utilization | 20 | Percent of cache to allow to be used for table scans.
|early | set | When set, replicants will ack a transaction as soon as they acquire locks - not that replication must succeed at that point, and reads on that node will either see the records or block.
