# Physical log based replication

This is a replication scheme that relies on physical logs generated by Berkeley DB to
replicate changes to other nodes asynchronously. The replicant nodes (a.k.a. physreps)
pull the physical logs from the source machine and apply it locally.

It is important to note that physreps are applying the logs out-of-band and, thus,
should not be considered part of the source cluster.

In order to enable replication, `replicate_from` must be added to the copycomdb2-d
physrep's lrl file. This line can either take a valid Comdb2 cluster tier, a
hostname or a comma-separated list of hostnames (without any space).

```
replicate_from source_dbname @source_host/source_tier
```

Physical replicants started with the above configuration will start replicating
directly off of the specified source host or one of the nodes in the cluster tier.

## Setup tiered replication topology
Physical replicants pull logs from the source by executing a SELECT query. Thus any
physrep added to the system would add to the overall cost incurred by the source
host/cluster. 

In order to avoid having source support all physreps directly, one could setup tiered
replication in which some physical replicants could become the source for the other
replicants, thus keeping some load off of the top-level source host/cluster.

```

                            S       |                    -- tier 0 
                           / \      |
                          /   \     | log-flow
                         R1   R2    |                    -- tier 1
                        / \     \   |
                       /   \     \  v
                      R3   R4    R5                      -- tier 2
```

Note: The source cluster nodes are always considered at tier 0.

Setting up tiered replication topology requires 2 base tables to maintain the
current state of replication as well as the replication topology.

* comdb2_physreps
* comdb2_physrep_connection

These tables automatically get updated to reflect the changes as replicants
join or leave the system and thus are not designed to be manually modified
under normal circumstances. In order to keep the load evenly spread, these table
are consulted to ensure a certain fanout `physrep_fanout` is maintained across all
the nodes. The LSN information in `comdb2_physreps` table is used by all the
nodes to pause log-deletion.

## Algorithm

On start, a physical replicant executes `sys.physrep.register_replicant()` against
the `physrep_metadb`, which in turn, responds with a list of potential nodes that
can be used as the source of physical logs. The replicant then picks up a node from
the list and tries to connect to it. On successful connection, the replicant executes
`sys.physrep.update_registry()` against the `physrep_metadb`, confirming that the
replicant is now `connected` to a node.

Upon successful registration, the physical replicants execute
```SELECT .. FROM .. comdb2_transaction_logs```
to retrieve (PULL) log records, which is then applied locally. The replicants also
periodically execute `sys.physrep.keepalive()` against `physrep_metadb` to inform
about their current LSN. This information is used by the nodes to control log-deletion.

### Cross-tier replication

In certain setups, where a TCP connection is not permitted from a lower replication 
tier (say development) to a higher replication tier (say production), the PULL
strategy disussed above will not work.

So, in order to enable physical replicants, running in development tier, replicate
from source nodes running in production tier, we force them to wait for a connection
from a node in production tier, and when a connection arrives, the replicants use
that to execute the (reverse) query to read logs from `comdb2_transaction_logs`.

```
                      ,------- S <-------,
                      |(1) connect       |
                      |                  |                         (production)
----------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------
                      |                  |                        (development)
                      |                  |(2) execute `SELECT .. FROM comdb2_transaction_logs`
                      `------> R1 -------'
```

Now, the question is, how would the nodes in production know which node(s) in development
to connect to? They get this information from `physrep_metadb's` `comdb2_physrep_sources`
table. This table can be updated with all the source->target information, based on
which a replicant (in development) waits for a connection (`sys.physrep.should_wait_for_con()`)
and the source nodes (in production) can connect to the physrep nodes by getting a list
from the same table (`sys.physrep.should_wait_for_con()`).
NOTE: In cross-tier replication, the replication metadata tables must be hosted by a
separate database running in the a lower (development) tier.

## Physical replication metadata tables

### comdb2_physreps
```
CREATE TABLE comdb2_physreps(dbname CSTRING(60),
                             host CSTRING(120),
                             file INT,
                             offset INT,
                             last_keepalive DATETIME,
                             state CSTRING(60),
                             UNIQUE (dbname, host))
```
* Physical replicant states:
    * `Pending`  : The node has requested to become a physical replicant (registration in-progress)
    * `Active`   : The node is a physical replicant
    * `Inactive` : The node might not be actively replicating; not allowed to become a replication source 

### comdb2_physrep_connections
```
CREATE TABLE comdb2_physrep_connections(dbname CSTRING(60),
                                        host CSTRING(120),
                                        source_dbname CSTRING(60),
                                        source_host CSTRING(120),
                                        UNIQUE (dbname, host, source_dbname, source_host), 
                                        FOREIGN KEY(dbname, host) REFERENCES comdb2_physreps(dbname, host) ON DELETE CASCADE)
```

### comdb2_physrep_sources
```
CREATE TABLE comdb2_physrep_sources(dbname CSTRING(60),
                                    host CSTRING(120),
                                    source_dbname CSTRING(60),
                                    source_host CSTRING(120),
                                    UNIQUE (dbname, host, source_dbname, source_host))
```

## lrl configurations

* replicate_from dbname @host/tier: This line sets the source host/cluster. It is required for all physical replicants.
* replicate_wait <sec>: Tells the physical replicant to wait for this many seconds before applying the log records.
* physrep_metadb: If set, all the nodes will connect to this database (as against source host/cluster mentioned via `replicate_from`) for replication metadata tables
* physrep_ignore <tables>: All the log records that belong to any of these tables are ignored by physical replicants
* nonames: This configuration forces system database file names to not carry the database name. This setting is required for physical-log based replication to work properly.
* elect_highest_committed_gen: Bias election by the highest generation in the logfile. This setting is required for physical-log based replication to work properly.
* autoanalyze: Since physical replicants run in read-only mode, autoanalyze would not have any effect on the state of 'stat' tables. Thus, it is recommended to keep it turned off.

## Stored procedures

* sys.cmd.start_replication: Start replication threads
* sys.cmd.stop_replication: Stop replication threads

Note: Based on the current lrls (and existence of replication matadata tables)
the replication threads are created automatically on start.

There are additional stored procedures that nodes participating in the physical
replication execute to perform various tasks from setting up to maintining the
state of physical replication. These procedures should be considered internal
and not be executed manually.

* sys.physrep.register_replicant: A request to register a new physical replicant. This is the first step of registration. 
* sys.physrep.update_registry: As the second step of registration, the physrep executes this to confirm that it is successfully connected to a node.
* sys.physrep.keepalive: Is executed by replicants periodically to report their current LSNs.
* sys.physrep.reset_nodes: Is executed to reset states of nodes in replication metadb.
* sys.physrep.topology: Returns a list of all the nodes in the system alongside their tiers.
* sys.physrep.get_reverse_hosts: Returns pairs of dbname/host against which the source node must periodically send `reversesql` requests.
* sys.physrep.should_wait_for_con: This is used by physreps to check whether they should wait for a 'reversesql' connection from a source host.
