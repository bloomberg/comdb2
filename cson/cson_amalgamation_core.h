/** @page page_cson cson JSON API

cson (pronounced "season") is an object-oriented C API for generating
and consuming JSON (http://www.json.org) data.

Its main claim to fame is that it can parse JSON from, and output it
to, damned near anywhere. The i/o routines use a callback function to
fetch/emit JSON data, allowing clients to easily plug in their own
implementations. Implementations are provided for string- and
FILE-based i/o.

    This is the type of double value used by the library.

    long double the memory requirements for such values goes
    up.

    Note that by default cson uses C-API defaults for numeric
    precision. To use a custom precision throughout the library, one
    needs to define the macros CSON_DOUBLE_T_SFMT and/or
    CSON_DOUBLE_T_PFMT macros to include their desired precision, and
    must build BOTH cson AND the client using these same values. For
    example:

    @code

compilation warnings in 32-bit builds even though the code
being warned about cannot ever be called. To get around such
warnings, when building on a 64-bit environment you can define
this to 1 to get "big" integer support. HOWEVER, all clients must
also use the same value for this macro. If i knew a halfway reliable
way to determine this automatically at preprocessor-time, i would
automate this. We might be able to do halfway reliably by looking
for a large INT_MAX value?

/** @struct cson_value
   
   The core value type of this API. It is opaque to clients, and
   only the cson public API should be used for setting or
   inspecting their values.

   This class is opaque because stack-based usage can easily cause
   leaks if one does not intimately understand the underlying
   internal memory management (which sometimes changes).

   It is (as of 20110323) legal to insert a given value instance into
   multiple containers (they will share ownership using reference
   counting) as long as those insertions do not cause cycles. However,
   be very aware that such value re-use uses a reference to the
   original copy, meaning that if its value is changed once, it is
   changed everywhere. Also beware that multi-threaded write
   operations on such references leads to undefined behaviour.
   
   PLEASE read the ACHTUNGEN below...

   ACHTUNG #1:

   cson_values MUST NOT form cycles (e.g. via object or array
   entries).

   Not abiding th Holy Law Of No Cycles will lead to double-frees and
   the like (i.e. undefined behaviour, likely crashes due to infinite
   recursion or stepping on invalid (freed) pointers).

   ACHTUNG #2:
   
   ALL cson_values returned as non-const cson_value pointers from any
   public functions in the cson API are to be treated as if they are
   heap-allocated, and MUST be freed by client by doing ONE of:
   
   - Passing it to cson_value_free().
   
   - Adding it to an Object or Array, in which case the object/array
   takes over ownership. As of 20110323, a value may be inserted into
   a single container multiple times, or into multiple containers,
   in which case they all share ownership (via reference counting)
   of the original value (meaning any changes to it are visible in
   all references to it).
   
   Each call to cson_value_new_xxx() MUST eventually be followed up
   by one of those options.
   
   Some cson_value_new_XXX() implementations do not actually allocate
   memory, but this is an internal implementation detail. Client code
   MUST NOT rely on this behaviour and MUST treat each object
   returned by such a function as if it was a freshly-allocated copy
   (even if their pointer addresses are the same).
   
   ACHTUNG #3:

   Note that ACHTUNG #2 tells us that we must always free (or transfer
   ownership of) all pointers returned bycson_value_new_xxx(), but
   that two calls to (e.g.) cson_value_new_bool(1) will (or might)
   return the same address. The client must not rely on the
   "non-allocation" policy of such special cases, and must pass each
   returned value to cson_value_free(), even if two of them have the
   same address.  Some special values (e.g. null, true, false, integer
   0, double 0.0, and empty strings) use shared copies and in other
   places reference counting is used internally to figure out when it
   is safe to destroy an object.

/** @var cson_rc

   This object defines the error codes used by cson.

   Library routines which return int values almost always return a
   value from this structure. None of the members in this struct have
   published values except for the OK member, which has the value 0.
   All other values might be incidentally defined where clients
   can see them, but the numbers might change from release to
   release, so clients should only use the symbolic names.

   Client code is expected to access these values via the shared
   cson_rc object, and use them as demonstrated here:

   @code
   int rc = cson_some_func(...);
   if( 0 == rc ) {...success...}
   else if( cson_rc.ArgError == rc ) { ... some argument was wrong ... }
   else if( cson_rc.AllocError == rc ) { ... allocation error ... }
   ...

    If it finds the given path, it returns the value by assiging *tgt

   - obj or path are NULL: cson_rc.ArgError
    
    - separator is 0, or path is an empty string or contains only

    - It has no way to fetch data from arrays this way. i could
    imagine, e.g., a path of "subobj.subArray.0" for
    subobj.subArray[0], or "0.3.1" for [0][3][1]. But i'm too
    lazy/tired to add this.

    Example usage:
    

    Assume we have a JSON structure which abstractly looks like:

    @code
    {"subobj":{"subsubobj":{"myValue":[1,2,3]}}}
    @endcode

    Out goal is to get the value of myValue. We can do that with:

    @code
    cson_value * v = NULL;
    int rc = cson_object_fetch_sub( object, &v, "subobj.subsubobj.myValue", '.' );
    @endcode

    Note that because keys in JSON may legally contain a '.', the
    separator must be specified by the caller. e.g. the path
    "subobj/subsubobj/myValue" with separator='/' is equivalent the
    path "subobj.subsubobj.myValue" with separator='.'. The value of 0
    is not legal as a separator character because we cannot
    distinguish that use from the real end-of-string without requiring
    the caller to also pass in the length of the string.
   
    Multiple successive separators in the list are collapsed into a
    single separator for parsing purposes. e.g. the path "a...b...c"
    (separator='.') is equivalent to "a.b.c".

/**
   Increments the reference count for the given value. This is a
   low-level operation and should not normally be used by client code
   without understanding exactly what side-effects it introduces.
   Mis-use can lead to premature destruction or cause a value instance
   to never be properly destructed (i.e. a memory leak).

   This function is probably only useful for the following cases:

   - You want to hold a reference to a value which is itself contained
   in one or more containers, and you need to be sure that your
   reference outlives the container(s) and/or that you can free your
   copy of the reference without invaliding any references to the same
   value held in containers.

   - You want to implement "value sharing" behaviour without using an
   object or array to contain the shared value. This can be used to
   ensure the lifetime of the shared value instance. Each sharing
   point adds a reference and simply passed the value to
   cson_value_free() when they're done. The object will be kept alive
   for other sharing points which added a reference.

   Normally any such value handles would be invalidated when the
   parent container(s) is/are cleaned up, but this function can be
   used to effectively delay the cleanup.
   
   This function, at its lowest level, increments the value's
   reference count by 1.

   To decrement the reference count, pass the value to
   cson_value_free(), after which the value must be considered, from
   the perspective of that client code, to be destroyed (though it
   will not be if there are still other live references to
   it). cson_value_free() will not _actually_ destroy the value until
   its reference count drops to 0.

   Returns 0 on success. The only error conditions are if v is NULL
   (cson_rc.ArgError) or if the reference increment would overflow
   (cson_rc.RangeError). In theory a client would get allocation
   errors long before the reference count could overflow (assuming
   those reference counts come from container insertions, as opposed
   to via this function).

   Insider notes which clients really need to know:
   
   For shared/constant value instances, such as those returned by
   cson_value_true() and cson_value_null(), this function has no side
   effects - it does not actually modify the reference count because
   (A) those instances are shared across all client code and (B) those
   objects are static and never get cleaned up. However, that is an
   implementation detail which client code should not rely on. In
   other words, if you call cson_value_add_reference() 3 times using
   the value returned by cson_value_true() (which is incidentally a
   shared cson_value instance), you must eventually call
   cson_value_free() 3 times to (semantically) remove those
   references. However, internally the reference count for that
   specific cson_value instance will not be modified and those
   objects will never be freed (they're stack-allocated).

   It might be interesting to note that newly-created objects
   have a reference count of 0 instead of 1. This is partly because
   if the initial reference is counted then it makes ownership
   problematic when inserting values into containers. e.g. consider the
   following code:

   @code
   // ACHTUNG: this code is hypothetical and does not reflect
   // what actually happens!
   cson_value * v =
        cson_value_new_integer( 42 ); // v's refcount = 1
   cson_array_append( myArray, v ); // v's refcount = 2
   @endcode

   If that were the case, the client would be forced to free his own
   reference after inserting it into the container (which is a bit
   counter-intuitive as well as intrusive). It would look a bit like
   the following and would have to be done after every create/insert
   operation:

   @code
   // ACHTUNG: this code is hypothetical and does not reflect
   // what actually happens!
   cson_array_append( myArray, v ); // v's refcount = 2
   cson_value_free( v ); // v's refcount = 1
   @endcode

   (As i said: it's counter-intuitive and intrusive.)

   Instead, values start with a refcount of 0 and it is only increased
   when the value is added to an object/array container or when this
   function is used to manually increment it. cson_value_free() treats
   a refcount of 0 or 1 equivalently, destroying the value
   instance. The only semantic difference between 0 and 1, for
   purposes of cleaning up, is that a value with a non-0 refcount has
   been had its refcount adjusted, whereas a 0 refcount indicates a
   fresh, "unowned" reference.

   value (e.g. number/string/boolean). If cv is not NULL then this
   function makes a deep clone of it and returns that clone. Ownership
   of the clone is identical t transfered to the caller, who must
   eventually free the value using cson_value_free() or add it to a
   container object/array to transfer ownership to the container. The
   returned object will be of the same logical type as orig.

   ACHTUNG: if orig contains any cyclic references at any depth level
   this function will endlessly recurse. (Having _any_ cyclic
   references violates this library's requirements.)
   
   Returns NULL if orig is NULL or if cloning fails. Assuming that
   orig is in a valid state, the only "likely" error case is that an
   allocation fails while constructing the clone. In other words, if
   cloning fails due to something other than an allocation error then
   either orig is in an invalid state or there is a bug.

   When this function clones Objects or Arrays it shares any immutable
   values (including object keys) between the parent and the
   clone. Mutable values (Objects and Arrays) are copied, however.
   For example, if we clone:

   @code
   { a: 1, b: 2, c:["hi"] }
   @endcode

   The cloned object and the array "c" would be a new Object/Array
   instances but the object keys (a,b,b) and the values of (a,b), as
   well as the string value within the "c" array, would be shared
   between the original and the clone. The "c" array itself would be
   deeply cloned, such that future changes to the clone are not
   visible to the parent, and vice versa, but immutable values within
   the array are shared (in this case the string "hi"). The
   justification for this heuristic is that immutable values can never
   be changed, so there is no harm in sharing them across
   clones. Additionally, such types can never contribute to cycles in
   a JSON tree, so they are safe to share this way. Objects and
   Arrays, on the other hand, can be modified later and can contribute
   to cycles, and thus the clone needs to be an independent instance.
   Note, however, that if this function directly passed a
   non-Object/Array, that value is deeply cloned. The sharing
   behaviour only applies when traversing Objects/Arrays.

/**
   Returns the value handle associated with s. The handle itself owns
   s, and ownership of the handle is not changed by calling this
   function. If the returned handle is part of a container, calling
   cson_value_free() on the returned handle invoked undefined
   behaviour (quite possibly downstream when the container tries to
   use it).

   This function only returns NULL if s is NULL. The length of the
   returned string is cson_string_length_bytes().

/**
   Calculates the approximate in-memory-allocated size of v,
   recursively if it is a container type, with the following caveats
   and limitations:

   If a given value is reference counted then it is only and multiple
   times within a traversed container, each reference is counted at
   full cost. We have no way of knowing if a given reference has been
   visited already and whether it should or should not be counted, so
   we pessimistically count them even though the _might_ not really
   count for the given object tree (it depends on where the other open
   references live).

   This function returns 0 if any of the following are true:

   - v is NULL

   - v is one of the special singleton values (null, bools, empty
   string, int 0, double 0.0)

   All other values require an allocation, and this will return their
   total memory cost, including the cson-specific internals and the
   native value(s).

   Note that because arrays and objects might have more internal slots
   allocated than used, the alloced size of a container does not
   necessarily increase when a new item is inserted into it. An interesting
   side-effect of this is that when cson_clone()ing an array or object, the
   size of the clone can actually be less than the original.

/**
   Parses command-line-style arguments into a JSON object.

   It expects arguments to be in any of these forms, and any number
   of leading dashes are treated identically:

   --key : Treats key as a boolean with a true value.

   --key=VAL : Treats VAL as either a double, integer, or string.

   --key= : Treats key as a JSON null (not literal NULL) value.

   Arguments not starting with a dash are skipped.
   
   Each key/value pair is inserted into an object.  If a given key
   appears more than once then only the final entry is actually
   stored.

   argc and argv are expected to be values from main() (or similar,
   possibly adjusted to remove argv[0]).

   tgt must be either a pointer to NULL or a pointer to a
   client-provided Object. If (NULL==*tgt) then this function
   allocates a new object and on success it stores the new object in
   *tgt (it is owned by the caller). If (NULL!=*tgt) then it is
   assumed to be a properly allocated object. DO NOT pass a pointer to
   an unitialized pointer, as that will fool this function into
   thinking it is a valid object and Undefined Behaviour will ensue.

   If count is not NULL then the number of arugments parsed by this
   function are assigned to it. On error, count will be the number of
   options successfully parsed before the error was encountered.

   On success:

   - 0 is returned.

   - If (*tgt==NULL) then *tgt is assigned to a newly-allocated
   object, owned by the caller. Note that even if no arguments are
   parsed, the object is still created.

   On error:

   - non-0 is returned

   - If (*tgt==NULL) then it is not modified.

   - If (*tgt!=NULL) (i.e., the caller provides his own object) then
   it might contain partial results.
