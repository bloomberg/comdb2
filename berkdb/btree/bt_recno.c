/*
 * In recno, there are two meanings to the on-page "deleted" flag.  If we're
 * re-numbering records, it means the record was implicitly created.  We skip
 * over implicitly created records if doing a cursor "next" or "prev", and
 * return DB_KEYEMPTY if they're explicitly requested..  If not re-numbering
 * records, it means that the record was implicitly created, or was deleted.
 * We skip over implicitly created or deleted records if doing a cursor "next"
 * or "prev", and return DB_KEYEMPTY if they're explicitly requested.
 *
 * If we're re-numbering records, then we have to detect in the cursor that
 * a record was deleted, and adjust the cursor as necessary on the next get.
 * If we're not re-numbering records, then we can detect that a record has
 * been deleted by looking at the actual on-page record, so we completely
 * ignore the cursor's delete flag.  This is different from the B+tree code.
 * It also maintains whether the cursor references a deleted record in the
 * cursor, and it doesn't always check the on-page value.
